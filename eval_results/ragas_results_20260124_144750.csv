Multiple potential mechanisms of action have been proposed: inhibition of the mitochondrial respiratory chain (complex I), activation of AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK), inhibition of glucagon-induced elevation of cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP) with reduced activation of protein kinase A (PKA), complex IV–mediated inhibition of the GPD2 variant of mitochondrial glycerol-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (thereby reducing the contribution of glycerol to hepatic gluconeogenesis), and an effect on gut microbiota.[27][105][106][107]\nMetformin exerts an anorexiant effect in most people, decreasing caloric intake.[26] Metformin decreases gluconeogenesis (glucose production) in the liver.[94][21] Metformin inhibits basal secretion from the pituitary gland of growth hormone, adrenocorticotropic hormone, follicle stimulating hormone, and expression of proopiomelanocortin,[108] which in part accounts for its insulin-sensitizing effect with multiple actions on tissues including the liver, skeletal muscle, endothelium, adipose tissue, and the ovaries.[55][34] The average person with type\xa02 diabetes has three times the normal rate of gluconeogenesis; metformin treatment reduces this by over one-third.[109]\nActivation of AMPK was required for metformin\'s inhibitory effect on liver glucose production.[110] AMPK is an enzyme that plays an important role in insulin signaling, whole-body energy balance, and the metabolism of glucose and fats.[111] AMPK activation is required for an increase in the expression of small heterodimer partner, which in turn inhibited the expression of the hepatic gluconeogenic genes phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase and glucose 6-phosphatase.[112] Metformin is frequently used in research along with AICA ribonucleotide as an AMPK agonist. The mechanism by which biguanides increase the activity of AMPK remains uncertain: metformin increases the concentration of cytosolic adenosine monophosphate (AMP) (as opposed to a change in total AMP or total AMP/adenosine triphosphate) which could activate AMPK allosterically at high levels;[113] a newer theory involves binding to PEN-2.[114] Metformin inhibits cyclic AMP production, blocking the action of glucagon, and thereby reducing fasting glucose levels.[115] Metformin also induces a profound shift in the faecal microbial community profile in diabetic mice, and this may contribute to its mode of action possibly through an effect on glucagon-like peptide-1 secretion.[106]\nIn addition to suppressing hepatic glucose production, metformin increases insulin sensitivity, enhances peripheral glucose uptake (by inducing the phosphorylation of GLUT4 enhancer factor), decreases insulin-induced suppression of fatty acid oxidation,[116] and decreases the absorption of glucose from the gastrointestinal tract. Increased peripheral use of glucose may be due to improved insulin binding to insulin receptors.[117] The increase in insulin binding after metformin treatment has also been demonstrated in patients with type\xa02 diabetes.[118]\nAMPK probably also plays a role in increased peripheral insulin sensitivity, as metformin administration increases AMPK activity in skeletal muscle.[119] AMPK is known to cause GLUT4 deployment to the plasma membrane, resulting in insulin-independent glucose uptake.[120] Some metabolic actions of metformin do appear to occur by AMPK-independent mechanisms, however, AMPK likely has a modest overall effect and its activity is not likely to directly decrease gluconeogenesis in the liver.[121]\nMetformin has indirect antiandrogenic effects in women with insulin resistance, such as those with PCOS, due to its beneficial effects on insulin sensitivity.[122] It may reduce testosterone levels in such women by as much as 50%.[122] A Cochrane review, though, found that metformin was only slightly effective for decreasing androgen levels in women with PCOS.[123]\nMetformin also has significant effects on the gut microbiome, such as its effect on increasing agmatine production by gut bacteria, but the relative importance of this mechanism compared to other mechanisms is uncertain.[124][125][126]\nDue to its effect on GLUT4 and AMPK, metformin has been described as an exercise mimetic.[127][128]\n\n[CITATION 2]\nSOURCE: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metformin                              # Diabetes / Pharmacology (metformin)\nTITLE: Metformin - Wikipedia\nPAGE: \nCHUNK: 23\nSNIPPET: ^ Towler MC, Hardie DG (February 2007).

It works by decreasing glucose production in the liver, increasing the insulin sensitivity of body tissues,[15] and increasing GDF15 secretion, which reduces appetite and caloric intake.[24][25][26][27]\nMetformin was first described in the scientific literature in 1922 by Emil Werner and James Bell.[28] French physician Jean Sterne began the study in humans in the 1950s.[28] It was introduced as a medication in France in 1957.[15][29] It is on the World Health Organization\'s List of Essential Medicines.[30] It is available as a generic medication.[15] In 2023, it was the second most commonly prescribed medication in the United States, with more than 85\xa0million prescriptions.[31][32] In Australia, it was one of the top 10 most prescribed medications between 2017 and 2023.[33]\n\n\nMedical uses[edit]\nMetformin is used to lower blood glucose in those with type\xa02 diabetes.[15] It has also been used to help with metabolic abnormalities in polycystic ovary syndrome, and as a second-line agent for infertility in those with polycystic ovary syndrome.[15][34]\n\nType 2 diabetes[edit]\nThe American Diabetes Association and the American College of Physicians both recommend metformin as a first-line agent to treat type 2 diabetes.[35][36][37] It is as effective as repaglinide and more effective than all other oral drugs for type 2 diabetes.[38]\n\nEfficacy[edit]\nSome evidence shows that metformin is associated with weight loss in obesity in the absence of diabetes.[39][40] Metformin has a lower risk of hypoglycemia than the sulfonylureas,[41][42] although hypoglycemia has uncommonly occurred during intense exercise, calorie deficit, or when used with other agents to lower blood glucose.[43][44] Metformin modestly reduces low density lipoprotein and triglyceride levels.[41][42]\nIn individuals with prediabetes, a 2019 systematic review comparing the effects of metformin with other interventions in the reduction of risk of developing type 2 diabetes found moderate-quality evidence that metformin reduced the risk of developing type 2 diabetes when compared to diet and exercise or a placebo.[45] However, when comparing metformin to intensive diet or exercise, moderate-quality evidence was found that metformin did not reduce risk of developing type 2 diabetes and very low-quality evidence was found that adding metformin to intensive diet or exercise did not show any advantage or disadvantage in reducing risk of type 2 diabetes when compared to intensive exercise and diet alone.[45] The same review also found one suitable trial comparing the effects of metformin and sulfonylurea in reducing the risk of developing type 2 diabetes in prediabetic individuals, however, this trial did not report any patient-relevant outcomes.[45]']","Metformin primarily works by decreasing glucose production (gluconeogenesis) in the liver.

stroke; diabetic retinopathy, which can result in blindness; kidney failure; and poor blood flow in the lower limbs, which may lead to amputations.[1] A sudden onset of hyperosmolar hyperglycemic state may occur; however, ketoacidosis is uncommon.[4][5]\nType\xa02 diabetes primarily occurs as a result of obesity and lack of exercise.[1] Some people are genetically more at risk than others.[6] Type\xa02 diabetes makes up about 90% of cases of diabetes, with the other 10% due primarily to type 1 diabetes and gestational diabetes.[1]\nDiagnosis of diabetes is by blood tests such as fasting plasma glucose, oral glucose tolerance test, or glycated hemoglobin (A1c).[3]\nType\xa02 diabetes is largely preventable by staying at a normal weight, exercising regularly, and eating a healthy diet (a popular example is a diet high in fruits and vegetables and low in sugar and saturated fat).[1]\nTreatment involves exercise and dietary changes.[1] If blood sugar levels are not adequately lowered, the medication metformin is typically recommended.[7][12] Many people may eventually also require insulin injections.[9] In those on insulin, routinely checking blood sugar levels (such as through a continuous glucose monitor) is advised; however, this may not be needed in those who are not on insulin therapy.[13] Bariatric surgery often improves diabetes in those who are obese.[8][14]\nRates of type\xa02 diabetes have increased markedly since 1960 in parallel with obesity.[15] As of 2015, there were approximately 392\xa0million people diagnosed with the disease compared to around 30\xa0million in 1985.[11][16] Typically, it begins in middle or older age,[6] although rates of type\xa02 diabetes are increasing in young people.[17][18] Type\xa02 diabetes is associated with a ten-year-shorter life expectancy.[10] Diabetes was one of the first diseases ever described, dating back to an Egyptian manuscript from c.\u20091500\xa0BCE.[19] Type\xa01 and type\xa02 diabetes were identified as separate conditions in 400–500\xa0CE with type\xa01 associated with youth and type\xa02 with being overweight.[20] The importance of insulin in the disease was determined in the 1920s.[21]\n\n[CITATION 2]\nSOURCE: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Type_2_diabetes                         # Diabetes / Endocrinology (T2D overview)\nTITLE: Type 2 diabetes - Wikipedia\nPAGE: \nCHUNK: 40\nSNIPPET: Signs and symptoms Overview of the most significant symptoms of diabetes The classic symptoms of diabetes are frequent urination (polyuria), increased thirst (polydipsia), increased hunger (polyphagia), and weight loss.[22] Other symptoms that are commonly present at diagnosis include a history of blurred vision, itchiness, peripheral neuropathy, recurrent vaginal infections, and fatigue.[23] Other symptoms may include loss of taste.[24]  Many people, however, have no symptoms during the first few years and are diagnosed on routine testing.[23] A small number of people with type\xa02 diabetes can develop a hyperosmolar hyperglycemic state (a condition of very high blood sugar associated with a decreased level of consciousness and low blood pressure).[23]  Complications Main article: Complications of diabetes Type\xa02 diabetes is typically a chronic disease associated with a ten-year-shorter life expectancy.[10][25] This is partly due to a number of complications with which it is associated, including: two to four\nCONTENT:\nSigns and symptoms\nOverview of the most significant symptoms of diabetes\nThe classic symptoms of diabetes are frequent urination (polyuria), increased thirst (polydipsia), increased hunger (polyphagia), and weight loss.[22] Other symptoms that are commonly present at diagnosis include a history of blurred vision, itchiness, peripheral neuropathy, recurrent vaginal infections, and fatigue.[23] Other symptoms may include loss of taste.[24]  Many people, however, have no symptoms during the first few years and are diagnosed on routine testing.[23] A small number of people with type\xa02 diabetes can develop a hyperosmolar hyperglycemic state (a condition of very high blood sugar associated with a decreased level of consciousness and low blood pressure).[23]\n\nComplications\nMain article: Complications of diabetes\nType\xa02 diabetes is typically a chronic disease associated with a ten-year-shorter life expectancy.[10][25] This is partly due to a number of complications with which it is associated, including: two to four times the risk of cardiovascular disease, including ischemic heart disease and stroke; a 20-fold increase in lower limb amputations, and increased rates of hospitalizations.[10] In the developed world, and increasingly elsewhere, type\xa02 diabetes is the largest cause of nontraumatic blindness and kidney failure.[26] It has also been associated with an increased risk of cognitive dysfunction and dementia through disease processes such as Alzheimer\'s disease and vascular dementia.[27] Other complications include hyperpigmentation of skin (acanthosis nigricans), sexual dysfunction, diabetic ketoacidosis, and frequent infections.[22][28][29] There is also an association between type 2 diabetes and mild hearing loss.[30]\n\nCauses\nThe development of type\xa02 diabetes is caused by a combination of lifestyle and genetic factors.[26][31] While some of these factors are under personal control, such as diet and obesity, other factors are not, such as increasing age, female sex, and genetics.[10] Generous consumption of alcohol is also a risk factor.[32] Obesity is more common in women than men in many parts of Africa.[33] The nutritional status of a mother during fetal development may also play a role.[34]\n\nLifestyle\nMain article: Lifestyle causes of type 2 diabetes\nLifestyle factors are important to the development of type\xa02 diabetes, including obesity and being overweight (defined by a body mass index of greater than 25), lack of physical activity, poor diet, psychological stress, and urbanization.[10][35] Excess body fat is associated with 30% of cases in those of Chinese and Japanese descent, 60–80% of cases in those of European and African descent, and 100% of cases in Pima Indians and Pacific Islanders.[23] Among those who are not obese, a high waist–hip ratio is often present.[23] Smoking appears to increase the risk of type\xa02 diabetes.[36] Lack of sleep has also been linked to type\xa02 diabetes.[37] Laboratory studies have linked short-term sleep deprivations to changes in glucose metabolism, nervous system activity, or hormonal factors that may lead to diabetes.[37]\nDietary factors also influence the risk of developing type\xa02 diabetes. Consumption of sugar-sweetened drinks in excess is associated with an increased risk.[38][39] The type of fats in the diet are important, with saturated fat and trans fatty acids increasing the risk, and polyunsaturated and monounsaturated fat decreasing the risk.[31] Eating a lot of white rice appears to play a role in increasing risk.[40] A lack of exercise is believed to cause 7% of cases.[41] Sedentary lifestyle is another risk factor.[42] Persistent organic pollutants may also play a role.[43]\n\n[CITATION 3]\nSOURCE: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Type_2_diabetes                         # Diabetes / Endocrinology (T2D overview)\nTITLE: Type 2 diabetes - Wikipedia\nPAGE: \nCHUNK: 52\nSNIPPET: ^ Reed J, Bain S, Kanamarlapudi V (August 2021).

Advances in developing more sensitive imaging techniques and biomarkers allow early detection of cardiotoxicity and allow cardioprotective intervention to prevent anthracycline-mediated cardiotoxicity.[35]\nThe predominant susceptibility of the heart to anthracyclines is due in part to a preferential mitochondrial localisation of anthracyclines. This is attributed to high affinity interaction between anthracyclines and cardiolipin, a phospholipid present in the heart mitochondrial membrane, as heart tissue contains a relatively high number of mitochondria per cell.[29] Heart tissue also has an impaired defence against oxidative stress, displaying a low level of anti-oxidant enzymes such as catalase and superoxide dismutase for detoxifying anthracycline-mediated ROS.[29]\nThe mechanisms accounting for anthracycline-induced cardiac damage are complex and interrelated. It was first recognised to be related to the oxidative stress induced by anthracyclines.[29] A more recent explanation has emerged, in which anthracycline-mediated cardiotoxicity is due to anthracycline-topoisomerase IIb poisoning, leading to downstream oxidative stress.[36]\nIn order to reduce the impact of cardiac injury in response to anthracyclines, a few cardioprotective strategies have been explored. Liposomal formulations of anthracyclines (discussed below) have been developed and used to reduce cardiac damage.[37] Other novel anthracycline analogues such as epirubicin and idarubicin also provide options to reduce adverse cardiac events; these analogues have failed to show superior anti-cancer activity to the parent compounds.[6][35] An alternative drug administration method involving continuous infusion for 72 h as compared to bolus administration provides some protection and can be used when high cumulative doses are anticipated.[35]\nWhen anthracyclines are given intravenously, it may result in accidental extravasation at injection sites. It is estimated that the extravasation incidence ranges from 0.1% to 6%.[38] Extravasation causes serious complications to surrounding tissues with the symptoms of tissue necrosis and skin ulceration.[38] Dexrazoxane is primarily used to treat anthracyclines post-extravasation by acting as a topoisomerase II inhibitor as well as a chelating agent to reduce oxidative stress caused by anthracyclines.[38] Dexrazoxane has also been used with success as a cardioprotective compound in combination with doxorubicin in metastatic breast cancer patients who have been treated with more than 300\xa0mg/m2 doxorubicin,  as well as in patients who are anticipated to have a beneficial effect from high cumulative doses of doxorubicin.[39][37]\nThere is no high quality evidence to confirm if cardioprotective treatments are effective.[40] Studies of the cardioprotective nature of dexrazoxane, provide evidence that it can prevent heart damage without interfering with the anti-tumour effects of anthracycline treatment. Patients given dexrazoxane with their anthracycline treatment had their risk of heart failure reduced compared to those treated with anthracyclines without dexrazoxane. There was no effect on survival though.\n\n[CITATION 2]\nSOURCE: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anthracycline                           # Oncology / Chemotherapy (anthracyclines)\nTITLE: Anthracycline - Wikipedia\nPAGE: \nCHUNK: 66\nSNIPPET: DNA Intercalation[edit] Anthracyclines are readily taken up by cells and localised to the nucleus.

When the repair process fails, the lesions initiate programmed cell death.[6]\n\nReactive oxygen species[edit]\nThe quinone moiety of anthracyclines can undergo redox reactions to generate excessive reactive oxygen species (ROS) in the presence of oxidoreductive enzymes such as cytochrome P450 reductase, NADH dehydrogenase and xanthine oxidase. Converting quinone to semiquinone produces free radicals that actively react with oxygen to generate superoxides, hydroxyl radicals and peroxides.[28][29] In addition, the availability of cellular iron catalyses redox reactions and further generates ROS.[28][29] The excessive ROS that cannot be detoxified results in oxidative stress, DNA damage, and lipid peroxidation thereby triggering apoptosis.[28][29]\n\nDNA adduct formation[edit]\nAnthracyclines can also form adducts with DNA by a single covalent bond through an aminal linkage from the 3\'-amino of daunosamine to the exocyclic amino of guanine.[30] The supply of extracellular formaldehyde using formaldehyde-releasing prodrugs can promote covalent DNA adduct formation. Such adducts have been shown to block GpC specific transcription factors and induce apoptotic responses.[30][31]\n\nClinical implications[edit]\nResults from a recent meta-analysis provide evidence that breast cancer patients with either duplication of centromere 17 or aberrations in TOP2A, the gene coding for topoisomerase-IIα, benefit from adjuvant chemotherapy that incorporates anthracyclines.[32] This does not include subgroups of patients that harbour amplification of HER2. The observations from this study also allow patients to be identified where anthracyclines might be safely omitted from treatment strategies.[32]\n\nSide effects[edit]\nAnthracycline administration is often accompanied by adverse drug reactions that limit the use of anthracyclines in the clinics. Two major dose limiting toxicities of anthracyclines include myelosuppression and cardiotoxicity. Fortunately, the introduction of therapeutic cytokines allows management of myelosuppression.[29][21] Hence, cardiac injury remains as the major drawback of anthracycline-based anti-cancer agents. Cardiotoxicity in patients and mice can be mitigated by circulating hemopexin.[33]\nAnthracycline-mediated cardiotoxicity is dose-dependent and cumulative, with the damage imposed to heart occurring upon the very first dose and then accumulating with each anthracycline cycle.

Chemotherapy may be given with a curative intent (which almost always involves combinations of drugs), or it may aim only to prolong life or to reduce symptoms (palliative chemotherapy).

Therapies with specific molecular or genetic targets, which inhibit growth-promoting signals from classic endocrine hormones (primarily estrogens for breast cancer and androgens for prostate cancer), are now called hormonal therapies. Other inhibitions of growth-signals, such as those associated with receptor tyrosine kinases, are targeted therapy.\nThe use of drugs (whether chemotherapy, hormonal therapy, or targeted therapy) is systemic therapy for cancer: they are introduced into the blood stream (the system) and therefore can treat cancer anywhere in the body. Systemic therapy is often used with other, local therapy (treatments that work only where they are applied), such as radiation, surgery, and hyperthermia.\nTraditional chemotherapeutic agents are cytotoxic by means of interfering with cell division (mitosis) but cancer cells vary widely in their susceptibility to these agents. To a large extent, chemotherapy can be thought of as a way to damage or stress cells, which may then lead to cell death if apoptosis is initiated. Many of the side effects of chemotherapy can be traced to damage to normal cells that divide rapidly and are thus sensitive to anti-mitotic drugs: cells in the bone marrow, digestive tract and hair follicles. This results in the most common side-effects of chemotherapy: myelosuppression (decreased production of blood cells, hence that also immunosuppression), mucositis (inflammation of the lining of the digestive tract), and alopecia (hair loss). Because of the effect on immune cells (especially lymphocytes), chemotherapy drugs often find use in a host of diseases that result from harmful overactivity of the immune system against self (so-called autoimmunity).

The drugs differ in their mechanism and side-effects. The biggest advantage is minimising the chances of resistance developing to any one agent.

For these regimens, in general, a better toxicity profile is expected.[6]:\u200a55–59\u200a\nAll chemotherapy regimens require that the recipient be capable of undergoing the treatment. Performance status is often used as a measure to determine whether a person can receive chemotherapy, or whether dose reduction is required.  Because only a fraction of the cells in a tumor die with each treatment (fractional kill), repeated doses must be administered to continue to reduce the size of the tumor.[10] Current chemotherapy regimens apply drug treatment in cycles, with the frequency and duration of treatments limited by toxicity.[11]\n\nEffectiveness[edit]\nThe effectiveness of chemotherapy depends on the type of cancer and the stage. The overall effectiveness ranges from being curative for some cancers, such as some leukemias,[12][13] to being ineffective, such as in some brain tumors,[14] to being needless in others, like most non-melanoma skin cancers.[15]""]","Chemotherapy in oncology is a cancer treatment that uses one or more anti-cancer drugs, also known as chemotherapeutic agents, in a standard regimen.

The source of the spacers was a sign that the CRISPR-cas system could have a role in adaptive immunity in bacteria.[29][35] All three studies proposing this idea were initially rejected by high-profile journals, but eventually appeared elsewhere.[36]\nThe first publication[33] proposing a role of CRISPR-Cas in microbial immunity, by Mojica, et al., predicted a role for the RNA transcript of spacers on target recognition in a mechanism that could be analogous to the RNA interference system used by eukaryotic cells. Koonin and colleagues extended this RNA interference hypothesis by proposing mechanisms of action for the different CRISPR-Cas subtypes according to the predicted function of their proteins.[37]\nExperimental work by several groups revealed the basic mechanisms of CRISPR-Cas immunity. In 2007, the first experimental evidence that CRISPR was part of the adaptive immune system was published.[7][12] A CRISPR region in Streptococcus thermophilus acquired spacers from the DNA of an infecting bacteriophage. The researchers manipulated the resistance of S. thermophilus to different types of phages by adding and deleting spacers whose sequence matched those found in the phages.[38][39] In 2008, Brouns and Van der Oost identified a complex of Cas proteins called Cascade, that in E. coli cut the CRISPR RNA precursor within the repeats into mature spacer-containing RNA molecules called CRISPR RNA (crRNA), which remained bound to the protein complex.[40] Cascade, crRNA and a helicase/nuclease (Cas3) were required to provide a bacterial host with immunity against infection by a DNA virus. By designing an anti-virus CRISPR, they demonstrated that two orientations of the crRNA (sense/antisense) provided immunity, indicating that the crRNA guides were targeting dsDNA. That year Marraffini and Sontheimer confirmed that a CRISPR sequence of S. epidermidis targeted DNA and not RNA to prevent conjugation. This finding was at odds with the proposed RNA-interference-like mechanism of CRISPR-Cas immunity, although a CRISPR-Cas system that targets foreign RNA was later found in Pyrococcus furiosus.[12][39] A 2010 study reported that CRISPR-Cas cuts strands of both phage and plasmid DNA in S. thermophilus.[41]\nIn 2012, Jinek et al., fused crRNA and tracrRNA into a single-guide RNA, simplifying Cas9 targeting.[42] Šikšnys, et al., reported that Cas9 from S. thermophilus can target specific DNA by altering crRNA.[43] In 2013, Cong, et al., as well as Mali, et al., applied CRISPR-Cas9 to edit human cell cultures.[44][45] In 2015, Liang, et al., edited human tripronuclear zygotes, achieving successful cleavage in 28 of 54 embryos.[46]\n\nCas9[edit]\nMain article: Cas9\nA diagram of the CRISPR nucleases Cas12a and Cas9 with the position of DNA cleavage shown relative to their PAM sequences in a zoom-in\nA simpler CRISPR system from S pyogenes uses Cas9, an endonuclease functioning with two small RNAs—crRNA and tracrRNA—to form a four-component complex.[47][48] In 2012, Doudna and Charpentier simplified this into a two-component system by fusing the RNAs into a single-guide RNA, enabling Cas9 to target and cut specific DNA sequences—a breakthrough that earned them the 2020 Nobel Prize in Chemistry.[49] Parallel work showed the S. thermophilus Cas9 could be similarly reprogrammed by altering the crRNA sequence.[19] These developments spurred genome editing efforts, including demonstrations by groups led by Zhang and Church showing genome editing in human cells using CRISPR-Cas9.[12][50][51]\n\n[CITATION 2]\nSOURCE: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CRISPR                                  # Genetics / Gene editing (CRISPR overview)\nTITLE: CRISPR -

It depends on two factors for its specificity: the target sequence and the protospacer adjacent motif (PAM) sequence. The target sequence is 20 bases long as part of each CRISPR locus in the crRNA array.[65] A typical crRNA array has multiple unique target sequences. Cas9 proteins select the correct location on the host\'s genome by utilizing the sequence to bond with base pairs on the host DNA. The sequence is not part of the Cas9 protein and as a result is customizable and can be independently synthesized.[82][83]\nThe PAM sequence on the host genome is recognized by Cas9. Cas9 cannot be easily modified to recognize a different PAM sequence. However, this is ultimately not too limiting, as it is typically a very short and nonspecific sequence that occurs frequently at many places throughout the genome (e.g. the SpCas9 PAM sequence is 5\'-NGG-3\' and in the human genome occurs roughly every 8 to 12 base pairs).[65]\nOnce these sequences have been assembled into a plasmid and transfected into cells, the Cas9 protein with the help of the crRNA finds the correct sequence in the host cell\'s DNA and – depending on the Cas9 variant – creates a single- or double-stranded break at the appropriate location in the DNA.[84]\nProperly spaced single-stranded breaks in the host DNA can trigger homology directed repair, which is less error-prone than the non-homologous end joining or theta-mediated end joining that typically follows a double-stranded break. Providing a DNA repair template allows for the insertion of a specific DNA sequence at an exact location within the genome. The repair template should extend 40 to 90 base pairs beyond the Cas9-induced DNA break.[65] The goal is for the cell\'s native HDR process to utilize the provided repair template and thereby incorporate the new sequence into the genome. Once incorporated, this new sequence is now part of the cell\'s genetic material and passes into its daughter cells. Combined transient inhibition of NHEJ and TMEJ by a small molecule and siRNAs can increase HDR efficiency to up to 93% and simultaneously prevent off-target editing.[85]\n\nDelivery[edit]\nSee also: Transfection\nDelivery of Cas9, sgRNA, and associated complexes into cells can occur via viral and non-viral systems. Electroporation of DNA, RNA, or ribonucleocomplexes is a common technique, though it can result in harmful effects on the target cells.[86] Chemical transfection techniques utilizing lipids and peptides have also been used to introduce sgRNAs in complex with Cas9 into cells.[87][88] Nanoparticle-based delivery has also been used for transfection.[89] Types of cells that are more difficult to transfect (e.g., stem cells, neurons, and hematopoietic cells) require more efficient delivery systems, such as those based on lentivirus (LVs), adenovirus (AdV), and adeno-associated virus (AAV).[90][91][92]\nEfficiency of CRISPR-Cas9 has been found to greatly increase when various components of the system including the entire CRISPR/Cas9 structure to Cas9-gRNA complexes delivered in assembled form rather than using transgenics.[93][94] This has found particular value in genetically modified crops for mass commercialization.[95][96] Since the host\'s replication machinery is not needed to produce these proteins, the chance of the recognizing sequence of the sgRNA is almost none, decreasing the chance of off-target effects.[89]\n\n[CITATION 2]\nSOURCE: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CRISPR_gene_editing                     # Genetics / Gene editing (CRISPR editing)\nTITLE: CRISPR gene editing - Wikipedia\nPAGE: \nCHUNK: 185\nSNIPPET: ^ Cox DB, Gootenberg JS, Abudayyeh OO, Franklin B, Kellner MJ, Joung J, et\xa0al.

By delivering the Cas9 nuclease complexed with a synthetic guide RNA (gRNA) into a cell, the cell\'s genome can be cut at a desired location, allowing existing genes to be removed or new ones added in vivo.[1]\nThe technique is considered highly significant in biotechnology and medicine as it enables in vivo genome editing and is considered exceptionally precise, cost-effective, and efficient. It can be used in the creation of new medicines, agricultural products, and genetically modified organisms, or as a means of controlling pathogens and pests. It also offers potential in the treatment of inherited genetic diseases as well as diseases arising from somatic mutations, such as cancer. However, its use in human germline genetic modification is highly controversial. The development of this technique earned Jennifer Doudna and Emmanuelle Charpentier the Nobel Prize in Chemistry in 2020.[2][3] The third researcher group that shared the Kavli Prize for the same discovery,[4] led by Virginijus Šikšnys, was not awarded the Nobel Prize.[5][6][7]\nWorking like genetic scissors, the Cas9 nuclease opens both strands of the targeted DNA sequence to introduce the modification by one of two methods. Knock-in mutations, facilitated via homology-directed repair (HDR), are the traditional pathway of targeted genomic editing approaches.[1] This allows for the introduction of targeted DNA damage and repair. HDR employs the use of similar DNA sequences to drive the repair of the break via the incorporation of exogenous DNA to function as the repair template.[1] This method relies on the periodic and isolated occurrence of DNA damage at the target site in order for the repair to commence. Knock-out mutations caused by CRISPR-Cas9 result from the repair of the double-stranded break by means of non-homologous end joining (NHEJ) or POLQ/polymerase theta-mediated end-joining (TMEJ). These end-joining pathways can often result in random deletions or insertions at the repair site, which may disrupt or alter gene functionality. Therefore, genomic engineering with CRISPR-Cas9 enables researchers to generate targeted random gene disruption.\nWhile genome editing in eukaryotic cells has been possible using various methods since the 1980s, the methods employed have proven to be inefficient and impractical for large-scale implementation. With the discovery of CRISPR and specifically the Cas9 nuclease molecule, efficient and highly selective editing became possible. Cas9, derived from the bacterial species Streptococcus pyogenes, has facilitated targeted genomic modification in eukaryotic cells by enabling a reliable method of creating a targeted break at a specific location as designated by the crRNA and tracrRNA guide strands.[8] Researchers can insert Cas9 and template RNA with ease in order to silence or cause point mutations at specific loci. This has proven invaluable for quick and efficient mapping of genomic models and biological processes associated with various genes in a variety of eukaryotes. Newly engineered variants of the Cas9 nuclease that significantly reduce off-target activity have been developed.[9]']","After Cas9 creates a double-strand break, the two main DNA repair pathways are homology-directed repair (HDR) and non-homologous end joining (NHEJ) or theta-mediated end joining (TMEJ). HDR, which is less error-prone, facilitates knock-in mutations by incorporating a specific DNA repair template. Conversely, NHEJ and TMEJ often lead to random deletions or insertions, typically resulting in knock-out mutations that disrupt gene functionality.","Cells primarily repair Cas9-induced double-strand breaks via non-homologous end joining (NHEJ), which often introduces insertions/deletions causing gene disruption, or homology-directed repair (HDR), which can introduce precise edits using a donor template.",1.0,0.8101161608001876,0.9999999999,1.0

Bradykinin levels increase because angiotensin-converting enzyme also degrades bradykinin, and its inhibition reduces bradykinin inactivation.[45]\nUnder normal conditions, angiotensin II has these effects:[46]\n\nVasoconstriction (narrowing of blood vessels) and vascular smooth muscle hypertrophy (enlargement) induced by ATII may lead to increased blood pressure and hypertension. Further, constriction of the efferent arterioles of the kidney leads to increased perfusion pressure in the glomeruli.\nIt contributes to ventricular remodeling and ventricular hypertrophy of the heart through stimulation of the proto-oncogenes c-fos, c-jun, c-myc, transforming growth factor beta (TGF-B), through fibrogenesis and apoptosis (programmed cell death).\nStimulation by ATII of the adrenal cortex to release aldosterone, a hormone that acts on kidney tubules, causes sodium and chloride ions retention and potassium excretion. Sodium is a ""water-holding"" ion, so water is also retained, which leads to increased blood volume, hence an increase in blood pressure.\nStimulation of the posterior pituitary to release vasopressin (antidiuretic hormone, ADH) also acts on the kidneys to increase water retention. If ADH production is excessive in heart failure, Na+ level in the plasma may fall (hyponatremia), and this is a sign of increased risk of death in heart failure patients.\nA decrease renal protein kinase C\nDuring the course of ACE inhibitor use, the production of ATII is decreased,[note 1][47] which prevents aldosterone release from the adrenal cortex.[47] This allows the kidney to excrete sodium ions along with obligate water, and retain potassium ions. This decreases blood volume, leading to decreased blood pressure.[47]\nEpidemiological and clinical studies have shown ACE inhibitors reduce the progress of diabetic nephropathy independently from their blood pressure-lowering effect.[48] This action of ACE inhibitors is used in the prevention of diabetic renal failure.[49]\nACE inhibitors have been shown to be effective for indications other than hypertension[50] even in patients with normal blood pressure.[51] The use of a maximum dose of ACE inhibitors in such patients (including for prevention of diabetic nephropathy, congestive heart failure, and prophylaxis of cardiovascular events) is justified,[52] because it improves clinical outcomes independently of the blood pressure-lowering effect of ACE inhibitors. Such therapy, of course, requires careful and gradual titration of the dose to prevent the effects of rapidly decreasing blood pressure (dizziness, fainting, etc.).[53][54]\nACE inhibitors have also been shown to cause a central enhancement of parasympathetic nervous system activity in healthy volunteers and patients with heart failure.[55][56] This action may reduce the prevalence of malignant cardiac arrhythmias, and the reduction in sudden death reported in large clinical trials.[57]\nACE Inhibitors also reduce plasma norepinephrine levels, and its resulting vasoconstriction effects, in heart failure patients, thus breaking the vicious circles of sympathetic and renin angiotensin system activation, which sustains the downward spiral in cardiac function in congestive heart failure[citation needed]\nThe ACE inhibitor enalapril has also been shown to reduce cardiac cachexia in patients with chronic heart failure.[58] Cachexia is a poor prognostic sign in patients with chronic heart failure.[59]\nACE inhibitors are under early investigation for the treatment of frailty and muscle wasting (sarcopenia) in elderly patients without heart failure.[60]\n\n[CITATION 2]\nSOURCE: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ACE_inhibitor                           # Cardiovascular / Pharmacology (ACE inhibitors)\nTITLE: ACE inhibitor - Wikipedia\nPAGE: \nCHUNK: 208\nSNIPPET: Class of medications used primarily to treat high blood pressure ""ACEI"" redirects here.

Bradykinin produces prostaglandin. This mechanism can explain the two most common side effects seen with ACE Inhibitors: angioedema and cough.\n\nFrequently prescribed ACE inhibitors include benazepril, zofenopril, perindopril, trandolapril, captopril, enalapril, lisinopril, and ramipril.\nMedical use[edit]\nACE inhibitors were initially approved for the treatment of hypertension and can be used alone or in combination with other anti-hypertensive medications.  Later, they were found useful for other cardiovascular and kidney diseases[4] including:\n\nAcute myocardial infarction (heart attack)[5]\nHeart failure (left ventricular systolic dysfunction)[6]\nKidney complications of diabetes mellitus (diabetic nephropathy) by means of decreasing the blood pressure and preventing glomerular hyperfiltration injury[7]\nIn treating high blood pressure, ACE inhibitors are often the first drug choice, particularly when diabetes is present,[8] but age can lead to different choices and it is common to need more than one drug to obtain the desired improvement. There are fixed-dose combination drugs, such as ACE inhibitor and thiazide combinations. ACE inhibitors have also been used in chronic kidney failure and kidney involvement in systemic sclerosis (hardening of tissues, as scleroderma renal crisis). In those with stable coronary artery disease, but no heart failure, benefits are similar to other usual treatments.[9]\nIn 2012, a meta-analysis published in the BMJ  described the protective role of ACE inhibitors in reducing the risk of pneumonia when compared to angiotensin II receptor blocker (ARBs).[10] The authors found a decreased risk in patients with previous stroke (54% risk reduction), with heart failure (37%  risk reduction), and of Asian descent (43% risk reduction vs 54% risk reduction in non-Asian population). However, no reduced pneumonia-related mortality was observed.[11]\n\nOther[edit]\nACE inhibitors may also be used to help decrease excessive water consumption in people with schizophrenia resulting in psychogenic polydipsia.[12][13] A double-blind, placebo-controlled trial showed that when used for this purpose, enalapril led to decreased consumption (determined by urine output and osmolality) in 60% of people;[14] the same effect has been demonstrated in other ACE inhibitors.[15]\nAdditionally ACE-I are commonly used after renal transplant to manage post-transplant erythrocytosis, a condition characterised by a persistently high hematocrit greater than 51% which often develops 8–24 months after successful transplantation,[16] as ACE-I have been shown to decrease erythropoietin production.[17]\n\n[CITATION 3]\nSOURCE: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ACE_inhibitor                           # Cardiovascular / Pharmacology (ACE inhibitors)\nTITLE: ACE inhibitor -

It converts the hormone angiotensin I to the active vasoconstrictor angiotensin II. Therefore, ACE indirectly increases blood pressure by causing blood vessels to constrict.

Thus, the same enzyme (ACE) that generates a vasoconstrictor (ANG II) also disposes of vasodilators (bradykinin).[11]\n\nMechanism[edit]\nACE is a zinc metalloproteinase.[13] The zinc center catalyses the peptide hydrolysis. Reflecting the critical role of zinc, ACE can be inhibited by metal-chelating agents.[14]\n\nACE in complex with inhibitor lisinopril, zinc cation shown in grey, chloride anions in yellow. Based on PyMOL rendering of PDB 1o86. The picture shows that lisinopril is a competitive inhibitor, since it and angiotensin I are similar structurally.  Both bind to the active site of ACE.  The structure of the ACE-lisinopril complex was confirmed by X-ray crystallography.[15]\nThe E384 residue is mechanistically critical. As a general base, it deprotonates the zinc-bound water, producing a nucleophilic Zn-OH center. The resulting ammonium group then serves as a general acid to cleave the C-N bond.[16]\nThe function of the chloride ion is very complex and is highly debated. The anion activation by chloride is a characteristic feature of ACE.[17] It was experimentally determined that the activation of hydrolysis by chloride is highly dependent on the substrate. While it increases hydrolysis rates for e.g. Hip-His-Leu it inhibits hydrolysis of other substrates like Hip-Ala-Pro.[16] Under physiological conditions the enzyme reaches about 60% of its maximal activity toward angiotensin I while it reaches its full activity toward bradykinin. It is therefore assumed that the function of the anion activation in ACE provides high substrate specificity.[17] Other theories say that the chloride might simply stabilize the overall structure of the enzyme.[16]\n\nGenetics[edit]\nThe ACE gene, ACE, encodes two isozymes. The somatic isozyme is expressed in many tissues, mainly in the lung, including vascular endothelial cells, epithelial kidney cells, and testicular Leydig cells, whereas the germinal is expressed only in sperm. Brain tissue has ACE enzyme, which takes part in local RAS and converts Aβ42 (which aggregates into plaques) to Aβ40 (which is thought to be less toxic) forms of beta amyloid. The latter is predominantly a function of N domain portion on the ACE enzyme. ACE inhibitors that cross the blood–brain barrier and have preferentially selected N-terminal activity may therefore cause accumulation of Aβ42 and progression of dementia.[citation needed]\n\n[CITATION 3]\nSOURCE: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Angiotensin-converting_enzyme           # Cardiovascular / Physiology (ACE / RAS)\nTITLE: Angiotensin-converting enzyme - Wikipedia\nPAGE: \nCHUNK: 233\nSNIPPET: Disease relevance[edit] ACE inhibitors are widely used as pharmaceutical drugs in the treatment of conditions such as high blood pressure, heart failure, diabetic nephropathy, and type 2 diabetes mellitus.

Some studies suggest that ACE inhibitors that are able to pass the blood-brain-barrier (BBB) could enhance the activity of major amyloid-beta peptide degrading enzymes like neprilysin in the brain resulting in a slower development of Alzheimer's disease.[20] More recent research suggests that ACE inhibitors can reduce risk of Alzheimer's disease in the absence of apolipoprotein E4 alleles (ApoE4), but will have no effect in ApoE4- carriers.[21] Another more recent hypothesis is that higher levels of ACE can prevent Alzheimer's. It is assumed that ACE can degrade beta-amyloid in brain blood vessels and therefore help prevent the progression of the disease.[22]\nA negative correlation between the ACE1 D-allele frequency and the prevalence and mortality of COVID-19 has been established.[23]\n\nPathology[edit]\nElevated levels of ACE are also found in sarcoidosis, and are used in diagnosing and monitoring this disease. Elevated levels of ACE are also found in leprosy, hyperthyroidism, acute hepatitis, primary biliary cirrhosis, diabetes mellitus, multiple myeloma, osteoarthritis, amyloidosis, Gaucher disease, pneumoconiosis, histoplasmosis and miliary tuberculosis. It is also noted in some patients with extensive plaque psoriasis.\nSerum levels are decreased in renal disease, obstructive pulmonary disease, and hypothyroidism.\nInfluence on athletic performance[edit]\nThe angiotensin converting enzyme gene has more than 160 polymorphisms described as of 2018.[24]\nStudies have shown that different genotypes of angiotensin converting enzyme can lead to varying influence on athletic performance.[25][26] However, these data should be interpreted with caution due to the relatively small size of the investigated groups.\nThe rs1799752 I/D polymorphism (aka rs4340, rs13447447, rs4646994) consists of either an insertion (I) or deletion (D) of a 287 base pair sequence in intron 16 of the gene.[24] The DD genotype is associated with higher plasma levels of the ACE protein, the DI genotype with intermediate levels, and II with lower levels.[24] During physical exercise, due to higher levels of the ACE for D-allele carriers, hence higher capacity to produce angiotensin II, the blood pressure will increase sooner than for I-allele carriers. This results in a lower maximal heart rate and lower maximum oxygen uptake (VO2max). Therefore, D-allele carriers have a 10% increased risk of cardiovascular diseases. Furthermore, the D-allele is associated with a greater increase in left ventricular growth in response to training compared to the I-allele.[27] On the other hand, I-allele carriers usually show an increased maximal heart rate due to lower ACE levels, higher maximum oxygen uptake and therefore show an enhanced endurance performance.[27] The I allele is found with increased frequency in elite distance runners, rowers and cyclists.

The innate immune system is an alternate defense strategy and is the dominant immune system response found in plants, fungi, prokaryotes, and invertebrates (see §\xa0Beyond vertebrates).[2]\nThe major functions of the innate immune system are to:\n\nrecruit immune cells to infection sites by producing chemical factors, including chemical mediators called cytokines\nactivate the complement cascade to identify bacteria, activate cells, and promote clearance of antibody complexes or dead cells\nidentify and remove foreign substances present in organs, tissues, blood and lymph, by specialized white blood cells\nactivate the adaptive immune system through antigen presentation\nact as a physical and chemical barrier to infectious agents; via physical measures such as skin and mucus, and chemical measures such as clotting factors and host defence peptides.\ninitiates and regulates inflammatory responses by releasing inflammatory mediators (such as cytokines and chemokines), thereby promoting immune cell recruitment, increasing vascular permeability, and enhancing local immune defense at sites of infection.\n\nAnatomical barriers[edit]\nAnatomical barriers include physical, chemical and biological barriers. The epithelial surfaces form a physical barrier that is impermeable to most infectious agents, acting as the first line of defense against invading organisms.[3] Desquamation (shedding) of skin epithelium also helps remove bacteria and other infectious agents that have adhered to the epithelial surface. Lack of blood vessels, the inability of the epidermis to retain moisture, and the presence of sebaceous glands in the dermis, produces an environment unsuitable for the survival of microbes.[3] In the gastrointestinal and respiratory tract, movement due to peristalsis or cilia, respectively, helps remove infectious agents.[3] Also, mucus traps infectious agents.[3] Gut flora can prevent the colonization of pathogenic bacteria by secreting toxic substances or by competing with pathogenic bacteria for nutrients or cell surface attachment sites.[3] The flushing action of tears and saliva helps prevent infection of the eyes and mouth.[3]\n\n\n\nAnatomical barrier\nAdditional defense mechanisms\n\n\nSkin\nSweat (including dermcidin), cathelicidin, desquamation, flushing,[3] organic acids,[3] skin flora\n\n\nGastrointestinal tract\nPeristalsis, gastric acid, bile acids, digestive enzyme, flushing, thiocyanate,[3] defensins,[3] gut flora,[3] lysozymes\n\n\nRespiratory airways and lungs\nMucociliary escalator,[4] surfactant,[3] defensins[3]\n\n\nNasopharynx\nMucus, saliva, lysozyme[3]\n\n\nEyes\nTears[3]\n\n\nBlood–brain barrier\nendothelial cells (via passive diffusion/ osmosis & active selection).

Phagocytes generally patrol the body searching for pathogens, but can be called to specific locations by cytokines.[29] Once a pathogen has been engulfed by a phagocyte, it becomes trapped in an intracellular vesicle called a phagosome, which subsequently fuses with another vesicle called a lysosome to form a phagolysosome. The pathogen is killed by the activity of digestive enzymes or following a respiratory burst that releases free radicals into the phagolysosome.[30][31] Phagocytosis evolved as a means of acquiring nutrients, but this role was extended in phagocytes to include engulfment of pathogens as a defense mechanism.[32] Phagocytosis probably represents the oldest form of host defense, as phagocytes have been identified in both vertebrate and invertebrate animals.[33]\nNeutrophils and macrophages are phagocytes that travel throughout the body in pursuit of invading pathogens.[34] Neutrophils are normally found in the bloodstream and are the most abundant type of phagocyte, representing 50% to 60% of total circulating leukocytes.[35] During the acute phase of inflammation, neutrophils migrate toward the site of inflammation in a process called chemotaxis and are usually the first cells to arrive at the scene of infection. Macrophages are versatile cells that reside within tissues and produce an array of chemicals including enzymes, complement proteins, and cytokines. They can also act as scavengers that rid the body of worn-out cells and other debris and as antigen-presenting cells (APCs) that activate the adaptive immune system.[36]\nDendritic cells are phagocytes in tissues that are in contact with the external environment; therefore, they are located mainly in the skin, nose, lungs, stomach, and intestines.[37] They are named for their resemblance to neuronal dendrites, as both have many spine-like projections. Dendritic cells serve as a link between the bodily tissues and the innate and adaptive immune systems, as they present antigens to T cells, one of the key cell types of the adaptive immune system.[37]\nGranulocytes are leukocytes that have granules in their cytoplasm. In this category are neutrophils, mast cells, basophils, and eosinophils. Mast cells reside in connective tissues and mucous membranes and regulate the inflammatory response.[38] They are most often associated with allergy and anaphylaxis.[35] Basophils and eosinophils are related to neutrophils. They secrete chemical mediators that are involved in defending against parasites and play a role in allergic reactions, such as asthma.[39]\nInnate lymphoid cells (ILCs) are a group of innate immune cells that are derived from common lymphoid progenitor and belong to the lymphoid lineage. These cells are defined by the absence of antigen-specific B- or T-cell receptor (TCR) because of the lack of recombination activating gene. ILCs do not express myeloid or dendritic cell markers.[40]\nNatural killer cells (NK cells) are lymphocytes and a component of the innate immune system that does not directly attack invading microbes.[41] Rather, NK cells destroy compromised host cells, such as tumor cells or virus-infected cells, recognizing such cells by a condition known as ""missing self"". This term describes cells with low levels of a cell-surface marker called MHC I (major histocompatibility complex)—a situation that can arise in viral infections of host cells.[42] Normal body cells are not recognized and attacked by NK cells because they express intact self MHC antigens. Those MHC antigens are recognized by killer cell immunoglobulin receptors, which essentially put the brakes on NK cells.[43]\n\n[CITATION 3]\nSOURCE: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Innate_immune_system                    # Immunology (innate immunity)\nTITLE: Innate immune system - Wikipedia\nPAGE: \nCHUNK: 246\nSNIPPET: redness of the skin, due to locally increased blood circulation; heat, either increased local temperature, such as a warm feeling around a localized infection, or a systemic fever; swelling of affected tissues, such as the upper throat during the common cold or joints affected by rheumatoid arthritis; increased production of mucus, which can cause symptoms like a runny nose or a productive cough; pain, inflammatory mediators directly stimulate and sensitize nociceptive nerve endings, resulting in  local pain, such as painful joints or a sore throat, or affecting the whole body, such as body aches; and possible dysfunction of involved organs/tissues.

C3 convertase will then split into C3a and C3b. C3a aids in promoting opsonization and increases inflammation by helping immune cells move to the infection site, whereas C3b helps in forming a protein complex which functions to insert itself into a pathogen’s membrane to cause cell lysis, killing the pathogen, known as the membrane attack complex, composed of proteins C5b-C9. \n\tThe alternative pathway follows a similar sequence as the classical pathway but begins with the spontaneous activation of C3. Activated C3 will bind directly to the pathogen’s surface and interacts with other proteins to form C3 convertase. At this point, the pathway will continue like the classical pathway and form the membrane attack complex and kill the pathogen via cell lysis. \n\tC3 is mechanistically essential for complement function, and deficiencies in C3 severely impair immune responses. A lack of C3-mediated opsonization is associated with defective dendritic cell differentiation, weakened memory B-cell responses, and impaired regulatory T-cell development, highlighting how C3 influences not only pathogen clearance but also broader adaptive immune processes (Zarantonello, 2022).[19]\n\nLectin: starts when lectins bind to mannose on bacteria\nElements of the complement cascade can be found in many non-mammalian species including plants, birds, fish, and some species of invertebrates.[20]\n\nWhite blood cells[edit]\nMain article: Leukocyte\nSee also: Cells of the innate immune system\nA scanning electron microscope image of normal circulating human blood.

The immune system interacts intimately with other systems, such as the endocrine[83][84] and the nervous[85][86][87] systems. The immune system also plays a crucial role in embryogenesis (development of the embryo), as well as in tissue repair and regeneration.[88]\n\nHormones[edit]\nHormones can act as immunomodulators, altering the sensitivity of the immune system. For example, female sex hormones are known immunostimulators of both adaptive[89] and innate immune responses.[90] Some autoimmune diseases such as lupus erythematosus strike women preferentially, and their onset often coincides with puberty. By contrast, male sex hormones such as testosterone seem to be immunosuppressive.[91] Other hormones appear to regulate the immune system as well, most notably prolactin, growth hormone and vitamin D.[92][93]\n\nVitamin D[edit]\nAlthough early cellular studies suggested vitamin D might influence immune responses, more recent large-scale clinical trials and meta-analyses (2022–2024) have found that vitamin D supplementation can reduce the risk and severity of autoimmune diseases such as rheumatoid arthritis and multiple sclerosis, and may modestly reduce the incidence of acute respiratory tract infections and improve tuberculosis outcomes.[94][95][96] A 2011 United States Institute of Medicine report stated that ""outcomes related to ... immune functioning and autoimmune disorders, and infections ... could not be linked reliably with calcium or vitamin D intake and were often conflicting.""[97]:\u200a5\n\n[CITATION 2]\nSOURCE: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adaptive_immune_system                  # Immunology (adaptive immunity)\nTITLE: Adaptive immune system - Wikipedia\nPAGE: \nCHUNK: 266\nSNIPPET: Passive memory[edit] Passive memory is usually short-term, lasting between a few days and several months.

Over the last century, two important factors have been developed to combat their spread: sanitation and immunization.[6] Immunization (commonly referred to as vaccination) is the deliberate induction of an immune response, and represents the single most effective manipulation of the immune system that scientists have developed.[6] Immunizations are successful because they utilize the immune system\'s natural specificity as well as its inducibility.[citation needed]\nThe principle behind immunization is to introduce an antigen, derived from a disease-causing organism, that stimulates the immune system to develop protective immunity against that organism, but that does not itself cause the pathogenic effects of that organism. An antigen (short for antibody generator), is defined as any substance that binds to a specific antibody and elicits an adaptive immune response.[2]\nMost viral vaccines are based on live attenuated viruses, whereas many bacterial vaccines are based on acellular components of microorganisms, including harmless toxin components.[2] Many antigens derived from acellular vaccines do not strongly induce an adaptive response, and most bacterial vaccines require the addition of adjuvants that activate the antigen-presenting cells of the innate immune system to enhance immunogenicity.[6]\n\n[CITATION 3]\nSOURCE: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adaptive_immune_system                  # Immunology (adaptive immunity)\nTITLE: Adaptive immune system - Wikipedia\nPAGE: \nCHUNK: 265\nSNIPPET: In insects[edit] For a long time it was thought that insects and other invertebrates possess only innate immune system. However, in recent years some of the basic hallmarks of adaptive immunity have been discovered in insects. Those traits are immune memory and specificity. Although the hallmarks are present the mechanisms are different from those in vertebrates. Immune memory in insects was discovered through the phenomenon of priming. When insects are exposed to non-lethal dose or heat killed bacteria they are able to develop a memory of that infection that allows them to withstand otherwise lethal dose of the same bacteria they were exposed to before.[15][16] Unlike in vertebrates, insects do not possess cells specific for adaptive immunity.

Instead those mechanisms are mediated by hemocytes. Hemocytes function similarly to phagocytes and after priming they are able to more effectively recognize and engulf the pathogen.[17] It was also shown that it is possible to transfer the memory into offspring. For example, in honeybees if the queen is infected with bacteria then the newly born workers have enhanced abilities in fighting with the same bacteria.[18] Other experimental model based on red flour beetle also showed pathogen specific primed memory transfer into offspring from both mothers and fathers.[19]\nMost commonly accepted theory of the specificity is based on Dscam gene. Dscam gene also known as Down syndrome cell adhesive molecule is a gene that contains 3 variable Ig domains. Those domains can be alternatively spliced reaching high numbers of variations.[20] It was shown that after exposure to different pathogens there are different splice forms of dscam produced. After the animals with different splice forms are exposed to the same pathogen only the individuals with the splice form specific for that pathogen survive.[20]\nOther mechanisms supporting the specificity of insect immunity is RNA interference (RNAi). RNAi is a form of antiviral immunity with high specificity.[21] It has several different pathways that all end with the virus being unable to replicate. One of the pathways is siRNA in which long double stranded RNA is cut into pieces that serve as templates for protein complex Ago2-RISC that finds and degrades complementary RNA of the virus. MiRNA pathway in cytoplasm binds to Ago1-RISC complex and functions as a template for viral RNA degradation. Last one is piRNA where small RNA binds to the Piwi protein family and controls transposones and other mobile elements.[22] Despite the research the exact mechanisms responsible for immune priming and specificity in insects are not well described.\n\nIn bacteria[edit]\nBacteria use CRISPR as part of their adaptive immune system to defend against bacteriophages.\nMain article: CRISPR\nCRISPR is a term in DNA research. It stands for clustered regularly-interspaced short palindromic repeats. These are part of the genetic code in prokaryotes: most bacteria and archaea have it. It is their defence against attack by viruses.[23] Its structure and function was discovered in the 21st century.[24][25][26]\nCRISPR has a lot of short repeated sequences. These sequences are part of an adaptive immune system for prokaryotes. It allows them to remember and counter the bacteriophages which prey on them. They work as a kind of acquired immune system for bacteria.[27][28]\n\nImmunological memory[edit]\nFurther information: Immunity (medical)\nWhen B cells and T cells are activated some become memory B cells and some memory T cells. Throughout the lifetime of an animal these memory cells form a database of effective B and T lymphocytes. Upon interaction with a previously encountered antigen, the appropriate memory cells are selected and activated. In this manner, the second and subsequent exposures to an antigen produce a stronger and faster immune response. This is ""adaptive"" in the sense that the body\'s immune system prepares itself for future challenges, but is ""maladaptive"" of course if the receptors are autoimmune. Immunological memory can be in the form of either passive short-term memory or active long-term memory.[citation needed]']","Immunological memory refers to the ability of the immune system to remember specific pathogens it has previously encountered, allowing it to mount a stronger and faster response upon subsequent exposure. This memory is established by long-lived memory B cells and T cells that develop after initial activation. The adaptive immune system is primarily responsible for immunological memory, as it generates these specific memory cells as an adaptation to infection.","Immunological memory is the ability to mount a faster and stronger response upon re-exposure to a specific antigen, primarily mediated by adaptive immunity through memory B and T lymphocytes.",1.0,0.7602009724046652,0.9999999999,1.0

Unlike many other cells, most innate immune leukocytes cannot divide or reproduce on their own, but are the products of multipotent hematopoietic stem cells present in bone marrow.[21][22]\nThe innate leukocytes include: natural killer cells, mast cells, eosinophils, basophils; and the phagocytic cells include macrophages, neutrophils, and dendritic cells, and function within the immune system by identifying and eliminating pathogens that might cause infection.[2]\n\n[CITATION 2]\nSOURCE: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immune_system                           # Immunology (overview)\nTITLE: Immune system - Wikipedia\nPAGE: \nCHUNK: 279\nSNIPPET: Innate immune cells[edit] A scanning electron microscope image of normal circulating human blood.

Phagocytes generally patrol the body searching for pathogens, but can be called to specific locations by cytokines.[29] Once a pathogen has been engulfed by a phagocyte, it becomes trapped in an intracellular vesicle called a phagosome, which subsequently fuses with another vesicle called a lysosome to form a phagolysosome. The pathogen is killed by the activity of digestive enzymes or following a respiratory burst that releases free radicals into the phagolysosome.[30][31] Phagocytosis evolved as a means of acquiring nutrients, but this role was extended in phagocytes to include engulfment of pathogens as a defense mechanism.[32] Phagocytosis probably represents the oldest form of host defense, as phagocytes have been identified in both vertebrate and invertebrate animals.[33]\nNeutrophils and macrophages are phagocytes that travel throughout the body in pursuit of invading pathogens.[34] Neutrophils are normally found in the bloodstream and are the most abundant type of phagocyte, representing 50% to 60% of total circulating leukocytes.[35] During the acute phase of inflammation, neutrophils migrate toward the site of inflammation in a process called chemotaxis and are usually the first cells to arrive at the scene of infection. Macrophages are versatile cells that reside within tissues and produce an array of chemicals including enzymes, complement proteins, and cytokines. They can also act as scavengers that rid the body of worn-out cells and other debris and as antigen-presenting cells (APCs) that activate the adaptive immune system.[36]\nDendritic cells are phagocytes in tissues that are in contact with the external environment; therefore, they are located mainly in the skin, nose, lungs, stomach, and intestines.[37] They are named for their resemblance to neuronal dendrites, as both have many spine-like projections. Dendritic cells serve as a link between the bodily tissues and the innate and adaptive immune systems, as they present antigens to T cells, one of the key cell types of the adaptive immune system.[37]\nGranulocytes are leukocytes that have granules in their cytoplasm. In this category are neutrophils, mast cells, basophils, and eosinophils. Mast cells reside in connective tissues and mucous membranes and regulate the inflammatory response.[38] They are most often associated with allergy and anaphylaxis.[35] Basophils and eosinophils are related to neutrophils. They secrete chemical mediators that are involved in defending against parasites and play a role in allergic reactions, such as asthma.[39]\nInnate lymphoid cells (ILCs) are a group of innate immune cells that are derived from common lymphoid progenitor and belong to the lymphoid lineage. These cells are defined by the absence of antigen-specific B- or T-cell receptor (TCR) because of the lack of recombination activating gene. ILCs do not express myeloid or dendritic cell markers.[40]\nNatural killer cells (NK cells) are lymphocytes and a component of the innate immune system that does not directly attack invading microbes.[41] Rather, NK cells destroy compromised host cells, such as tumor cells or virus-infected cells, recognizing such cells by a condition known as ""missing self"". This term describes cells with low levels of a cell-surface marker called MHC I (major histocompatibility complex)—a situation that can arise in viral infections of host cells.[42] Normal body cells are not recognized and attacked by NK cells because they express intact self MHC antigens. Those MHC antigens are recognized by killer cell immunoglobulin receptors, which essentially put the brakes on NK cells.[43]\n\n[CITATION 3]\nSOURCE: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immune_system                           # Immunology (overview)\nTITLE: Immune system - Wikipedia\nPAGE: \nCHUNK: 277\nSNIPPET: ReadEditView history        Tools      Tools move to sidebar hide    \t\tActions \t   ReadEditView history      \t\tGeneral \t   What links hereRelated changesUpload filePermanent linkPage informationCite this pageGet shortened URLDownload QR code      \t\tPrint/export \t   Download as PDFPrintable version      \t\tIn other projects \t   Wikimedia CommonsWikiquoteWikiversityWikidata item                      Appearance move to sidebar hide            From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia    Biological system protecting an organism against disease   Immune systemA scanning electron microscope image of a single neutrophil (yellow/right), engulfing anthrax bacteria (orange/left) – scale bar is 5 μm (false color)IdentifiersMeSHD007107FMA9825Anatomical terminology[edit on Wikidata] The immune system is a network of biological systems that protects an organism from diseases.

It detects and responds to a wide variety of pathogens, such as viruses, bacteria, and parasites, as well as cancer cells and objects, such as wood splinters—distinguishing them from the organism\'s own healthy tissue. Many species have two major subsystems of the immune system. The innate immune system provides a preconfigured response to broad groups of situations and stimuli. The adaptive immune system provides a tailored response to each stimulus by learning to recognize molecules it has previously encountered. Both use molecules and cells to perform their functions.\nNearly all organisms have some kind of immune system. Bacteria have a rudimentary immune system in the form of enzymes that protect against viral infections. Other basic immune mechanisms evolved in ancient plants and animals and remain in their modern descendants. These mechanisms include phagocytosis, antimicrobial peptides called defensins, and the complement system. Jawed vertebrates, including humans, have even more sophisticated defense mechanisms, including the ability to adapt to recognize pathogens more efficiently. Adaptive (or acquired) immunity creates an immunological memory leading to an enhanced response to subsequent encounters with that same pathogen. This process of acquired immunity is the basis of vaccination.\nDysfunction of the immune system can cause autoimmune diseases, inflammatory diseases and cancer. Immunodeficiency occurs when the immune system is less active than normal, resulting in recurring and life-threatening infections. In humans, immunodeficiency can be the result of a genetic disease such as severe combined immunodeficiency, acquired conditions such as HIV/AIDS, or the use of immunosuppressive medication. Autoimmunity results from a hyperactive immune system attacking normal tissues as if they were foreign organisms. Common autoimmune diseases include Hashimoto\'s thyroiditis, rheumatoid arthritis, diabetes mellitus type 1, and systemic lupus erythematosus. Immunology covers the study of all aspects of the immune system.\n\n\nLayered defense[edit]\nThe immune system protects its host from infection with layered defenses of increasing specificity. Physical barriers prevent pathogens such as bacteria and viruses from entering the organism.[1] If a pathogen breaches these barriers, the innate immune system provides an immediate, but non-specific response. Innate immune systems are found in all animals.[2] If pathogens successfully evade the innate response, vertebrates possess a second layer of protection, the adaptive immune system, which is activated by the innate response.[3] Here, the immune system adapts its response during an infection to improve its recognition of the pathogen. This improved response is then retained after the pathogen has been eliminated, in the form of an immunological memory, and allows the adaptive immune system to mount faster and stronger attacks each time this pathogen is encountered.[4][5]\n\n\nComponents of the immune system\n\n\nInnate immune system\n\nAdaptive immune system\n\n\nResponse is non-specific\nPathogen and antigen specific response\n\n\nExposure leads to immediate maximal response\nLag time between exposure and maximal response\n\n\nCell-mediated and humoral components\nCell-mediated and humoral components\n\n\nNo immunological memory\nExposure leads to immunological memory\n\n\nFound in nearly all forms of life\nFound only in jawed vertebrates\n\nBoth innate and adaptive immunity depend on the ability of the immune system to distinguish between self and non-self molecules. In immunology, self molecules are components of an organism\'s body that can be distinguished from foreign substances by the immune system.[6] Conversely, non-self molecules are those recognized as foreign molecules. One class of non-self molecules are called antigens (originally named for being antibody generators) and are defined as substances that bind to specific immune receptors and elicit an immune response.[7]']","The innate immune system provides an immediate, non-specific defense and, if pathogens persist, activates the adaptive immune system. Innate immune cells like dendritic cells and macrophages present antigens to T cells, thus linking the two systems and initiating a tailored adaptive response. Furthermore, adaptive components, such as antibodies produced by B cells, can activate innate mechanisms like the complement system to eliminate pathogens.","Innate immunity provides immediate containment and antigen presentation signals, while adaptive immunity generates antigen-specific T and B cell responses; innate responses shape and activate adaptive responses, and adaptive immunity enhances pathogen clearance and provides memory.",1.0,0.7264837329291981,0.9999999999,1.0

Selective vulnerability - that is, why certain neurons and synapses are affected and others spared - is an important unanswered question.[130][129]\nIn more than half of the cases examined neuropathologically, and especially in very old people, the pathology of Alzheimer\'s disease is accompanied by lesions that are characteristic of other brain disorders.[122] The most common of these comorbid conditions are vascular disease, Lewy body disease, and TDP-43 proteinopathy.[122][131] This mixed pathology can complicate both diagnosis and the evaluation of clinical trials,[122] which often target only one of several potential contributors to dementia.\n\nBiochemistry[edit]\nMain article: Biochemistry of Alzheimer\'s disease\nAmyloid beta (Aβ)[edit]\nAlzheimer\'s disease has been identified as a protein misfolding disease, a proteopathy, caused by the accumulation of abnormally folded Aβ protein into amyloid plaques, and tau protein into neurofibrillary tangles in the brain.[132] Plaques are made up of small peptides, 39–43\xa0amino acids in length, called Aβ. Aβ is a fragment derived from the larger Aβ precursor protein (APP), a transmembrane protein that penetrates the cell\'s membrane. APP is critical to neuronal growth, survival, and post-injury repair.[132] In Alzheimer\'s disease, the enzymes gamma secretase and beta secretase act together in a proteolytic process that divides APP into smaller fragments.[132] One of these fragments is Aβ, which misfolds and self-assembles into fibrils; these fibrils form clumps that deposit outside neurons in dense formations known as Aβ plaques.[132] Excitatory neurons are known to be major producers of Aβ that contribute to extracellular plaque deposition.[132]\n\nEnzymes act on the amyloid-beta precursor protein and cut it into fragments. The beta-amyloid fragment is crucial in the formation of amyloid plaques in Alzheimer\'s disease.\nPhosphorylated tau[edit]\nAlzheimer\'s disease is also considered a tauopathy due to the abnormal aggregation of the tau protein within cells. Every neuron has a cytoskeleton, an internal support structure partly made up of organelles called microtubules. These microtubules act like tracks, guiding nutrients and molecules from the body of the cell to the ends of the axon and back. The tau protein stabilises the microtubules when phosphorylated, and it is therefore called a microtubule-associated protein. In Alzheimer\'s disease, tau undergoes chemical changes, becoming hyperphosphorylated; it then begins to pair with other threads, creating neurofibrillary tangles and disintegrating the neuron\'s transport system.[133] Pathogenic tau can also cause neuronal death through transposable element dysregulation.[134] Necroptosis has also been reported as a mechanism of cell death in brain cells affected with tau tangles.[135][136]\n\n[CITATION 2]\nSOURCE: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alzheimer%27s_disease                   # Neuroscience / Neurology (Alzheimer’s)\nTITLE: Alzheimer\'s disease - Wikipedia\nPAGE: \nCHUNK: 338\nSNIPPET: ^ Viswanathan A, Greenberg SM (December 2011).

In many cases the cortical sulci are widened and the gyri are shrunken,[118] but the degree of cortical atrophy varies, and it can sometimes be difficult to discern, particularly in very old subjects.[119] The areas most affected  by atrophy are the medial temporal lobe including the hippocampal formation, the amygdala, the frontal lobe and the parietal lobe; the occipital lobe is relatively unaffected by atrophy.[118] The volume of the ventricles increases in parallel with cortical shrinkage.[118] Studies using MRI and PET have documented reductions in the size of specific brain regions in people with Alzheimer\'s disease as they progress from mild cognitive impairment to Alzheimer\'s disease, and in comparison with similar images from healthy older adults.[120][121] These macroscopic changes in the brain can occur in other disorders and to some extent in normal aging; thus, they are not specific to Alzheimer\'s disease, which can be diagnosed with certainty only by microscopic examination of the brain.[119]\nAt the microscopic level, the defining histopathologic characteristics of Alzheimer\'s disease are abundant Aβ plaques and neurofibrillary tangles in certain brain regions.[122] Both of these abnormalities are clearly visible by microscopy;[123][118] in the early stages of disease, tangles are present mainly in the medial temporal lobe and plaques are present mainly in the neocortex, but as the disease progresses the lesions proliferate throughout much of the brain.[122] Although it was once thought that Alzheimer\'s disease can occur without neurofibrillary tangles in the neocortex,[124] newer methods have shown that dementia in these cases can be linked to a comorbid condition, often Lewy body disease.[86]\nAβ plaques are dense, mostly insoluble deposits of amyloid beta peptide and cellular material outside and around neurons.[94] Neurofibrillary tangles are aggregates of the microtubule-associated protein tau which has become hyperphosphorylated and accumulates inside neurons.[125][122] Although many older individuals develop some plaques and tangles as a consequence of aging, the brains of people with Alzheimer\'s disease have a greater number of them in specific brain regions.[126][118]']","The two major pathological hallmarks of Alzheimer's disease at the molecular level are amyloid-beta (Aβ) plaques and neurofibrillary (tau) tangles.

It is now believed that certain misfolded oligomers (known as ""seeds"") can induce other Aβ molecules to also take the misfolded oligomeric form, leading to a chain reaction akin to a prion infection. The oligomers are toxic to nerve cells.[5] The other protein implicated in Alzheimer\'s disease, tau protein, also forms such prion-like misfolded oligomers, and there is some evidence that misfolded Aβ can induce tau to misfold.[6][7]\nA study has suggested that APP and its amyloid potential is of ancient origins, dating as far back as early deuterostomes.[8]\n\n\nNormal function[edit]\nSee also: Amyloid precursor protein §\xa0Biological function\nThe normal function of Aβ is not yet known.[9]   Though some animal studies have shown that the absence of Aβ does not lead to any obvious loss of physiological function,[10][11] several potential activities have been discovered for Aβ, including activation of kinase enzymes,[12][13] protection against oxidative stress,[14][15] regulation of cholesterol transport,[16][17] functioning as a transcription factor,[18][19] and anti-microbial activity (potentially associated with Aβ\'s pro-inflammatory activity).[20][21][22]\nThe glymphatic system clears metabolic waste from the mammalian brain, and in particular amyloid beta.[23] A number of proteases have been implicated by both genetic and biochemical studies as being responsible for the recognition and degradation of amyloid beta; these include insulin degrading enzyme[24] and presequence protease.[25] The rate of removal is significantly increased during sleep.[26] However, the significance of the glymphatic system in Aβ clearance in Alzheimer\'s disease is unknown.[27]\n\nIntervention strategies[edit]\nAβ is the main component of the kind of amyloid plaques that form in the brains of people with Alzheimer\'s disease.[28] Aβ can also form the deposits that line cerebral blood vessels in cerebral amyloid angiopathy.[28] The plaques are composed of aggregated Aβ oligomers called amyloid fibrils, a protein fold shared by other peptides such as the prions associated with protein misfolding disease, also known as proteinopathy.[28]\n\n[CITATION 3]\nSOURCE: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amyloid_beta                            # Neuroscience / Molecular pathology (Aβ)\nTITLE: Amyloid beta - Wikipedia\nPAGE: \nCHUNK: 364\nSNIPPET: ^ Hiltunen M, van Groen T, Jolkkonen J (2009).

Tau proteins interact with tubulin to stabilize microtubules and promote tubulin assembly into microtubules.[11] Tau has two ways of controlling microtubule stability: isoforms and phosphorylation.\nIn addition to its microtubule-stabilizing function, Tau has also been found to recruit signaling proteins and to regulate microtubule-mediated axonal transport.[32]\n\nmRNA translation[edit]\nTau is a negative regulator of mRNA translation in Drosophila,[27] mouse,[33] and human[34] brains, through its binding to ribosomes, which results in impaired ribosomal function,[35] reduction of protein synthesis and altered synaptic function.[27][34] Tau interacts specifically with several ribosomal proteins, including the crucial regulator of translation rpS6.[36]\n\nBehavior[edit]\nThe primary non-cellular functions of tau is to negatively regulate long-term memory[27] and to facilitate habituation (a form of non-associative learning),[27] two higher and more integrated physiological functions. Since regulation of tau is critical for memory, this could explain the linkage between tauopathies and cognitive impairment.\nIn mice, while the reported tau knockout strains present without overt phenotype when young,[28][37][38] when aged, they show some muscle weakness, hyperactivity, and impaired fear conditioning.[39] However, neither spatial learning in mice,[39][40][41] nor short-term memory (learning) in Drosophila[27] seems to be affected by the absence of tau.\nIn addition, tau knockout mice have abnormal sleep-wake cycle, with increased wakefulness periods and decreased non-rapid eye movements (NREM) sleep time.[42]\n\nOther functions[edit]\nOther typical functions of tau include cellular signalling, neuronal development, neuroprotection and apoptosis.[29] Atypical, non-standard roles of tau[43] are also under current investigation, such as its involvement in chromosome stability, its interaction with the cellular transcriptome, its interaction with other cytoskeletal or synaptic proteins, its involvement in myelination or in brain insulin signaling, its role in the exposure to chronic stress and in depression, etc.\n\nMechanism[edit]\nThe accumulation of hyperphosphorylated tau in neurons is associated with neurofibrillary degeneration.[44] The actual mechanism of how tau propagates from one cell to another is not well identified. Also, other mechanisms, including tau release and toxicity, are unclear. As tau aggregates, it replaces tubulin, which in turn enhances fibrilization of tau.[45] Several propagation methods have been proposed that occur by synaptic contact such as synaptic cell adhesion proteins, neuronal activity and other synaptic and non-synaptic mechanisms.[46] The mechanism of tau aggregation is still not completely elucidated, but several factors favor this process, including tau phosphorylation and zinc ions.[47][48] Moreover, recent studies show that tau can coordinate up to three Zn²⁺ ions via distinct sites in the N-terminal, repeat, and C-terminal regions;[49] occupancy of two Zn²⁺ sites is sufficient to promote liquid–liquid phase separation (LLPS) of tau in vitro, linking zinc homeostasis to condensate-driven aggregation pathways.[50]\n\n[CITATION 3]\nSOURCE: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tau_protein                             # Neuroscience / Molecular pathology (tau)\nTITLE: Tau protein - Wikipedia\nPAGE: \nCHUNK: 376\nSNIPPET: Release[edit] Tau is involved in uptake and release processes, which are known as seeding.

Many enzymes are involved in toxicity mechanism such as PAR-1 kinase. This enzyme stimulates phosphorylation of serine 262 and 356, which in turn leads to activate other kinases (GSK-3 and CDK5) that cause disease-associated phosphoepitopes.[57] The degree of toxicity is affected by different factors, such as the degree of microtubule binding.[58][59] Toxicity could also happen by neurofibrillary tangles (NFTs), which leads to cell death and cognitive decline.\n\nClinical significance[edit]\nFurther information: Tauopathy\nHyperphosphorylation of the tau protein (tau inclusions, pTau) can result in the self-assembly of tangles of paired helical filaments and straight filaments, which are involved in the pathogenesis of Alzheimer's disease, frontotemporal dementia and other tauopathies.[60] All of the six tau isoforms are present in an often hyperphosphorylated state in paired helical filaments in the Alzheimer's disease brain. In other neurodegenerative diseases, the deposition of aggregates enriched in certain tau isoforms has been reported. When misfolded, this otherwise very soluble protein can form extremely insoluble aggregates that contribute to a number of neurodegenerative diseases. Tau protein has a direct effect on the breakdown of a living cell caused by tangles that form and block nerve synapses.[61]\nGender-specific tau gene expression across different regions of the human brain has recently been implicated in gender differences in the manifestations and risk for tauopathies.[62] Some aspects of how the disease functions also suggest that it has some similarities to prion proteins.[63]""]","Tau protein's primary normal cellular role is to maintain the stability of microtubules in axons, promoting their assembly and regulating microtubule-mediated axonal transport. In pathologies like Alzheimer's disease, tau becomes hyperphosphorylated and misfolded, aggregating into insoluble structures called neurofibrillary tangles. These tangles cause cellular toxicity, block nerve synapses, and lead to cell death and cognitive decline.","Tau is a microtubule-associated protein that stabilizes microtubules in neurons; abnormal hyperphosphorylation can cause tau to detach and aggregate into neurofibrillary tangles, disrupting intracellular transport.",1.0,0.7771508114983446,0.9999999999,0.0

On 2 December, the UK Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency (MHRA) became the first medicines regulator to approve an mRNA vaccine, authorizing the Pfizer–BioNTech vaccine for widespread use.[8][9][10] On 11 December, the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) issued an emergency use authorization for the Pfizer–BioNTech vaccine[11][12] and a week later similarly authorized the Moderna vaccine.[13][14] In 2023 the Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine was awarded to Katalin Karikó and Drew Weissman for their discoveries concerning modified nucleosides that enabled the development of effective mRNA vaccines against COVID-19.[15][16][17]\n\n\nHistory\nEarly research\nTimeline of some key discoveries and advances in the development of mRNA-based drug technology\nThe first successful transfection of designed mRNA packaged within a liposomal nanoparticle into a cell was published in 1989.[18][19] ""Naked"" (or unprotected) lab-made mRNA was injected a year later into the muscle of mice.[3][20] These studies were the first evidence that in vitro transcribed mRNA with a chosen gene was able to deliver the genetic information to produce a desired protein within living cell tissue[3] and led to the concept proposal of messenger RNA vaccines.[21][22][23]\nLiposome-encapsulated mRNA encoding a viral antigen was shown in 1993 to stimulate T cells in mice.[24][25] The following year self-amplifying mRNA was developed by including both a viral antigen and replicase encoding gene.[24][26] The method was used in mice to elicit both a humoral and cellular immune response against a viral pathogen.[24] The next year mRNA encoding a tumor antigen was shown to elicit a similar immune response against cancer cells in mice.[27][28]\n\n[CITATION 2]\nSOURCE: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MRNA_vaccine                            # Vaccinology / Immunology (mRNA vaccines)\nTITLE: mRNA vaccine - Wikipedia\nPAGE: \nCHUNK: 395\nSNIPPET: Development The first human clinical trial using ex vivo dendritic cells transfected with mRNA encoding tumor antigens (therapeutic cancer mRNA vaccine) was started in 2001.[29][30] Four years later, the successful use of modified nucleosides as a method to transport mRNA inside cells without setting off the body\'s defense system was reported.[29][31] Clinical trial results of an mRNA vaccine directly injected into the body against cancer cells were reported in 2008.[32][33] BioNTech in 2008, and Moderna in 2010, were founded to develop mRNA biotechnologies.[34][35] The US research agency DARPA launched at this time the biotechnology research program ADEPT to develop emerging technologies for the US military.[36][37] The agency recognized the potential of nucleic acid technology for defense against pandemics and began to invest in the field.[36] DARPA grants were seen as a vote of confidence that in turn encouraged other government agencies and private investors to invest in mRNA technology.[37] DARPA awarded\nCONTENT:\nDevelopment\nThe first human clinical trial using ex vivo dendritic cells transfected with mRNA encoding tumor antigens (therapeutic cancer mRNA vaccine) was started in 2001.[29][30] Four years later, the successful use of modified nucleosides as a method to transport mRNA inside cells without setting off the body\'s defense system was reported.[29][31] Clinical trial results of an mRNA vaccine directly injected into the body against cancer cells were reported in 2008.[32][33]\nBioNTech in 2008, and Moderna in 2010, were founded to develop mRNA biotechnologies.[34][35] The US research agency DARPA launched at this time the biotechnology research program ADEPT to develop emerging technologies for the US military.[36][37] The agency recognized the potential of nucleic acid technology for defense against pandemics and began to invest in the field.[36] DARPA grants were seen as a vote of confidence that in turn encouraged other government agencies and private investors to invest in mRNA technology.[37] DARPA awarded at the time a $25 million grant to Moderna.[38]\nThe first human clinical trials using an mRNA vaccine against an infectious agent (rabies) began in 2013.[39][40] Over the next few years, clinical trials of mRNA vaccines for a number of other viruses were started. mRNA vaccines for human use were studied for infectious agents such as influenza,[41] Zika virus, cytomegalovirus, and Chikungunya virus.[42][43]\n\nAcceleration\nThe COVID-19 pandemic, and sequencing of the causative virus SARS-CoV-2 at the beginning of 2020, led to the rapid development of the first approved mRNA vaccines.[44][45] BioNTech and Moderna in December of the same year obtained approval for their mRNA-based COVID-19 vaccines. On 2 December, seven days after its final eight-week trial, the UK Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency (MHRA) became the first global medicines regulator in history to approve an mRNA vaccine, granting emergency authorization for Pfizer–BioNTech\'s BNT162b2 COVID-19 vaccine for widespread use.[8][9][46] On 11 December, the FDA gave emergency use authorization for the Pfizer–BioNTech COVID-19 vaccine and a week later similar approval for the Moderna COVID-19 vaccine.[47]\n\nMechanism\nFurther information: Immune system\nAn illustration of the mechanism of action of a messenger RNA vaccine\nThe goal of a vaccine is to stimulate the adaptive immune system to create antibodies that precisely target that particular pathogen. The markers on the pathogen that the antibodies target are called antigens.[48]\nTraditional vaccines stimulate an antibody response by injecting either antigens, an attenuated (weakened) virus, an inactivated (dead) virus, or a recombinant antigen-encoding viral vector (harmless carrier virus with an antigen transgene) into the body. These antigens and viruses are prepared and grown outside the body.[49][50]\nIn contrast, mRNA vaccines introduce a short-lived[51] synthetically created fragment of the RNA sequence of a virus into the individual being vaccinated. These mRNA fragments are taken up by dendritic cells through phagocytosis.[52] The dendritic cells use their internal machinery (ribosomes) to read the mRNA and produce the viral antigens that the mRNA encodes.[4] The body degrades the mRNA fragments within a few days of introduction.[53] Although non-immune cells can potentially also absorb vaccine mRNA, produce antigens, and display the antigens on their surfaces, dendritic cells absorb the mRNA globules much more readily.[54] The mRNA fragments are translated in the cytoplasm and do not affect the body\'s genomic DNA, located separately in the cell nucleus.[1][55]\nOnce the viral antigens are produced by the host cell, the normal adaptive immune system processes are followed. Antigens are broken down by proteasomes. Class I and class II MHC molecules then attach to the antigen and transport it to the cellular membrane, ""activating"" the dendritic cell.[55] Once activated, dendritic cells migrate to lymph nodes, where they present the antigen to T cells and B cells.[56] This triggers the production of antibodies specifically targeted to the antigen, ultimately resulting in immunity.[48]\n\n[CITATION 3]\nSOURCE: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MRNA_vaccine                            # Vaccinology / Immunology (mRNA vaccines)\nTITLE: mRNA vaccine - Wikipedia\nPAGE: \nCHUNK: 405\nSNIPPET: ^ Goldman B (22 December 2020).

Mature mRNA is then read by the ribosome, and the ribosome creates the protein utilizing amino acids carried by transfer RNA (tRNA). This process is known as translation. All of these processes form part of the central dogma of molecular biology, which describes the flow of genetic information in a biological system.\nAs in DNA, genetic information in mRNA is contained in the sequence of nucleotides, which are arranged into codons consisting of three ribonucleotides each. Each codon codes for a specific amino acid, except the stop codons, which terminate protein synthesis. The translation of codons into amino acids requires two other types of RNA: transfer RNA, which recognizes the codon and provides the corresponding amino acid, and ribosomal RNA (rRNA), the central component of the ribosome\'s protein-manufacturing machinery.\nThe concept of mRNA was first conceived by Sydney Brenner and Francis Crick in 1960 during a conversation with François Jacob. In May 1961, messenger RNA was experimentally characterized in two back-to-back Nature papers: one by Brenner, Jacob, and Meselson, and one by Gros and colleagues (including Watson).[1][2] While analyzing the data in preparation for publication, Jacob and Jacques Monod coined the term ""messenger RNA"".\n\n\nSynthesis[edit]\nRNA polymerase transcribes a DNA strand to form mRNA\nThe brief existence of an mRNA molecule begins with transcription, and ultimately ends in degradation. During its life, an mRNA molecule may also be processed, edited, and transported prior to translation. Eukaryotic mRNA molecules often require extensive processing and transport, while prokaryotic mRNA molecules do not. A molecule of eukaryotic mRNA and the proteins surrounding it are together called a messenger RNP[3].\n\nTranscription[edit]\nMain article: Transcription (genetics)\nTranscription is the process by which genetic information stored in DNA is copied into RNA by the enzyme RNA polymerase.[4] During transcription, RNA polymerase binds to a promoter sequence on the DNA and synthesizes a complementary RNA strand (mRNA) from the DNA template.[5][4]\nThis process differs between prokaryotes and eukaryotes. In prokaryotes, transcription occurs in the cytoplasm.[5] Because prokaryotes lack a membrane-bound nucleus, ribosomes can attach to the nascent mRNA strand and begin translation while transcription is still in progress.[6]\nIn eukaryotes, transcription occurs within the cell nucleus.[7] The initial product of transcription is not functional mRNA but is termed precursor mRNA or pre-mRNA.[8] This pre-mRNA must undergo extensive processing (including 5\' capping, splicing to remove non-coding introns, and 3\' polyadenylation) to become mature mRNA.[8][7] Once processed, the mature mRNA is exported from the nucleus to the cytoplasm for translation.[7]\n\nUracil substitution for thymine[edit]\nWhereas DNA contains thymine (T), RNA contains uracil (U). During the process of transcription, the enzyme RNA polymerase incorporates uracil opposite adenine bases located on the DNA template strand. Therefore, the resulting RNA transcript contains uracil in the positions where the coding DNA strand contains thymine.[9][4]\nStructurally, uracil–adenine (U–A) base pairs closely resemble thymine–adenine (T–A) base pairs, which ensures that the genetic information carried by the sequence is faithfully preserved.[4]\nA frequently cited explanation for the presence of thymine in DNA involves the necessity of genome maintenance. Because cytosine can spontaneously deaminate to form uracil, DNA repair systems recognize uracil as a form of damage. The utilization of thymine as a standard base allows the cell to distinguish legitimate bases from errors, thereby maintaining uracil as a specific signal for repair.[10]\n\n[CITATION 2]\nSOURCE: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Messenger_RNA                           # Molecular biology (mRNA)\nTITLE: Messenger RNA - Wikipedia\nPAGE: \nCHUNK: 431\nSNIPPET: History[edit] Several molecular biology studies during the early 1950s suggested that RNA played a role in protein synthesis, though the specific role remained unclear. For example, in one of the earliest reports, Jacques Monod and his team showed that RNA synthesis was necessary for protein synthesis, specifically during the production of the enzyme β-galactosidase in the bacterium E. coli.[72] Arthur Pardee also found similar RNA accumulation in 1954.[73] In 1953, Alfred Hershey, June Dixon, and Martha Chase studied E. coli infected with bacteriophage T2 and reported that the bacterium\'s own DNA decreased while the phage\'s DNA built up inside the infected cells (including DNA containing 5-hydroxymethylcytosine).[74] In hindsight, this has been discussed as part of the chain of observations that led to the concept of mRNA, and it was not recognized at the time as such.[75] The idea of mRNA was first conceived by Sydney Brenner and Francis Crick on 15 April 1960 at King\'s College, Cambridge, while François Ja\nCONTENT:\nHistory[edit]\nSeveral molecular biology studies during the early 1950s suggested that RNA played a role in protein synthesis, though the specific role remained unclear.

With Crick\'s encouragement, Brenner and Jacob immediately set out to test this new hypothesis, and they contacted Matthew Meselson at the California Institute of Technology for assistance. During the summer of 1960, Brenner, Jacob, and Meselson conducted an experiment in Meselson\'s laboratory at Caltech which was the first to prove the existence of mRNA. That fall, Jacob and Monod coined the name ""messenger RNA"" and developed the first theoretical framework to explain its function.[75]\nIn February 1961, James Watson revealed that his Harvard-based research group had been right behind them with a series of experiments whose results pointed in roughly the same direction. Brenner and the others agreed to Watson\'s request to delay publication of their research findings. As a result, the Brenner and Watson articles were published simultaneously in the same issue of Nature in May 1961, while that same month, Jacob and Monod published their theoretical framework for mRNA in the Journal of Molecular Biology.[75]\n\nSee also[edit]\nExtension Poly(A) Test\nGeneCalling, an mRNA profiling technology\nMissense mRNA\nmRNA display\nmRNA surveillance\nProkaryotic mRNA degradation\nTranscriptome, the sum of all RNA in a cell\nmodRNA Nucleoside-modified messenger RNA\nReferences[edit]\n\n\n^ Brenner S, Jacob F, Meselson M (1961).

These proteins protect the bacterial cell from antibiotics that target the cell\'s ribosomes to inhibit protein synthesis. The mechanism involves the binding of the ribosomal protection proteins to the ribosomes of the bacterial cell, which in turn changes its conformational shape. This allows the ribosomes to continue synthesizing proteins essential to the cell while preventing antibiotics from binding to the ribosome to inhibit protein synthesis.[164]\nAlteration of metabolic pathway: for example, some sulfonamide-resistant bacteria do not require para-aminobenzoic acid (PABA), an important precursor for the synthesis of folic acid and nucleic acids in bacteria inhibited by sulfonamides, instead, like mammalian cells, they turn to using preformed folic acid.[165]\nReduced drug accumulation: by decreasing drug permeability or increasing active efflux (pumping out) of the drugs across the cell surface.[166] These multidrug efflux pumps within the cellular membrane of certain bacterial species are used to pump antibiotics out of the cell before they are able to do any damage. They are often activated by a specific substrate associated with an antibiotic,[167] as in fluoroquinolone resistance.[168]\nRibosome splitting and recycling: for example, drug-mediated stalling of the ribosome by lincomycin and erythromycin unstalled by a heat shock protein found in Listeria monocytogenes, which is a homologue of HflX from other bacteria. Liberation of the ribosome from the drug allows further translation and consequent resistance to the drug.[169]\nA number of mechanisms used by common antibiotics to deal with bacteria and ways by which bacteria become resistant to them\nThere are several different types of germs that have developed a resistance over time.\nThe six pathogens causing most deaths associated with resistance are Escherichia coli,  Staphylococcus aureus, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Streptococcus pneumoniae, Acinetobacter baumannii, and Pseudomonas aeruginosa. They were responsible for 929,000 deaths attributable to resistance and 3.57 million deaths associated with resistance in 2019.[18]\nPenicillinase-producing Neisseria gonorrhoeae developed a resistance to penicillin in 1976. Another example is Azithromycin-resistant Neisseria gonorrhoeae, which developed a resistance to azithromycin in 2011.[170]\nIn gram-negative bacteria, plasmid-mediated resistance genes produce proteins that can bind to DNA gyrase, protecting it from the action of quinolones. Finally, mutations at key sites in DNA gyrase or topoisomerase IV can decrease their binding affinity to quinolones, decreasing the drug\'s effectiveness.[171]\nSome bacteria are naturally resistant to certain antibiotics; for example, gram-negative bacteria are resistant to most β-lactam antibiotics due to the presence of β-lactamase. Antibiotic resistance can also be acquired as a result of either genetic mutation or horizontal gene transfer.[172] Although mutations are rare, with spontaneous mutations in the pathogen genome occurring at a rate of about 1 in 105 to 1 in 108 per chromosomal replication,[173] the fact that bacteria reproduce at a high rate allows for the effect to be significant. Given that lifespans and production of new generations can be on a timescale of mere hours, a new (de novo) mutation in a parent cell can quickly become an inherited mutation of widespread prevalence, resulting in the microevolution of a fully resistant colony. However, chromosomal mutations also confer a cost of fitness. For example, a ribosomal mutation may protect a bacterial cell by changing the binding site of an antibiotic but may result in slower growth rate.[174] Moreover, some adaptive mutations can propagate not only through inheritance but also through horizontal gene transfer.\n\n[CITATION 2]\nSOURCE: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antimicrobial_resistance                # Microbiology / Public health (AMR)\nTITLE: Antimicrobial resistance - Wikipedia\nPAGE: \nCHUNK: 479\nSNIPPET: ^ ""OIE Annual Report on Antimicrobial Agents Intended for Use in Animals"" (PDF).

Small populations of Escherichia coli in an antibiotic gradient can become resistant. Any heterogeneous environment with respect to nutrient and antibiotic gradients may facilitate antibiotic resistance in small bacterial populations. Researchers hypothesize that the mechanism of resistance evolution is based on four SNP mutations in the genome of E. coli produced by the gradient of antibiotic.[179]\nIn one study, which has implications for space microbiology, a non-pathogenic strain E. coli MG1655 was exposed to trace levels of the broad spectrum antibiotic chloramphenicol, under simulated microgravity (LSMMG, or Low Shear Modeled Microgravity) over 1000 generations. The adapted strain acquired resistance to not only chloramphenicol, but also cross-resistance to other antibiotics;[180] this was in contrast to the observation on the same strain, which was adapted to over 1000 generations under LSMMG, but without any antibiotic exposure; the strain in this case did not acquire any such resistance.[181] Thus, irrespective of where they are used, the use of an antibiotic would likely result in persistent resistance to that antibiotic, as well as cross-resistance to other antimicrobials.\nIn recent years, the emergence and spread of β-lactamases called carbapenemases has become a major health crisis.[182][183] One such carbapenemase is New Delhi metallo-beta-lactamase 1 (NDM-1),[184] an enzyme that makes bacteria resistant to a broad range of beta-lactam antibiotics. The most common bacteria that make this enzyme are gram-negative such as E. coli and Klebsiella pneumoniae, but the gene for NDM-1 can spread from one strain of bacteria to another by horizontal gene transfer.[185]']","Bacteria resist antibiotics through several common mechanisms. These include drug inactivation or modification, such as enzymatic deactivation or chemical alteration of the antibiotic. Another mechanism is the alteration of the antibiotic's target or binding site within the bacterial cell. Bacteria can also develop resistance by altering metabolic pathways or by reducing drug accumulation through decreased permeability or increased active efflux.","Common antibiotic resistance mechanisms include enzymatic drug inactivation (e.g., beta-lactamases), target modification, reduced permeability/uptake, and active efflux pumps that expel drugs from the cell; resistance can arise via mutation or horizontal gene transfer.",1.0,0.72134748519432,0.9999999999,1.0

AcrB, the other component of pump, Escherichia coli.\nAn efflux pump is an active transporter in cells that moves out unwanted material. Efflux pumps are an important component in bacteria, particularly in their ability to remove antibiotics.[1][2] The efflux process can also involve the movement of heavy metals, organic pollutants, plant-produced compounds, quorum sensing signals, bacterial metabolites, and neurotransmitters. All microorganisms, with a few exceptions, have highly conserved DNA sequences in their genome that encode efflux pumps. Efflux pumps actively move substances out of a microorganism, in a process known as active efflux, which is a vital part of xenobiotic metabolism. This active efflux mechanism is responsible for various types of resistance to bacterial pathogens within bacterial species, the most concerning being antibiotic resistance, as microorganisms can have adapted efflux pumps to divert toxins out of the cytoplasm and into extracellular media.[3]\nEfflux systems function via an energy-dependent mechanism (active transport) to pump out unwanted toxic substances through specific efflux pumps. Some efflux systems are drug-specific, whereas others can accommodate multiple drugs using small multidrug resistance (SMR) transporters.[4][5]\nEfflux pumps are proteinaceous transporters localized in the cytoplasmic membrane of all kinds of cells. They are active transporters, meaning that they require a source of chemical energy to perform their function. Some are primary active transporters utilizing adenosine triphosphate hydrolysis as a source of energy. In contrast, others are secondary active transporters (uniporters, symporters, or antiporters) in which transport is coupled to an electrochemical potential difference created by pumping hydrogen or sodium ions into the cell.\n\n\nBacterial[edit]\nBacterial efflux pumps are  classified into five major superfamilies, based on their amino acid sequence  and the energy source used to export their substrates:\n\n[CITATION 2]\nSOURCE: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Efflux_pump                             # Microbiology / Resistance mechanism (efflux)\nTITLE: Efflux pump - Wikipedia\nPAGE: \nCHUNK: 497\nSNIPPET: Impact on antimicrobial resistance[edit] Main article: Multidrug resistance pump The impact of efflux mechanisms on antimicrobial resistance is large; this is usually attributed to the following:  The genetic elements encoding efflux pumps may be encoded on chromosomes and/or plasmids, thus contributing to both intrinsic (natural) and acquired resistance, respectively.

They include monocarboxylate transporters (MCTs), multiple drug resistance proteins (MDRs)- also referred to as P-glycoprotein, multidrug resistance-associated proteins (MRPs), peptide transporters (PEPTs), and Na+ phosphate transporters (NPTs). These transporters are distributed along particular portions of the renal proximal tubule, intestine, liver, blood–brain barrier, and other portions of the brain.\n\nInhibitors[edit]\nSeveral trials are currently being conducted to develop drugs that can be co-administered with antibiotics to act as inhibitors for the efflux-mediated extrusion of antibiotics. As yet, no efflux inhibitor has been approved for therapeutic use, but some are being used to determine the prevalence of efflux pumps in clinical isolates and in cell biology research. Verapamil, for example, is used to block P-glycoprotein-mediated efflux of DNA-binding fluorophores, thereby facilitating fluorescent cell sorting for DNA content. Various natural products have been shown to inhibit bacterial efflux pumps, including the carotenoids capsanthin and capsorubin,[20] the flavonoids rotenone and chrysin[20] and the alkaloid lysergol.[21]  Some nanoparticles, for example, zinc oxide, also inhibit bacterial efflux pumps.[22]\n\nSee also[edit]\nAntibiotic resistance\nReferences[edit]\n\n^ Siasat PA, Blair J (October 2023).

Astrocyte cell projections called astrocytic feet (also known as ""glia limitans"") surround the endothelial cells of the BBB, providing biochemical support to those cells.[9] The BBB is distinct from the quite similar blood-cerebrospinal fluid barrier, which is a function of the choroidal cells of the choroid plexus, and from the blood-retinal barrier, which can be considered a part of the whole realm of such barriers.[10]\nNot all vessels in the human brain exhibit BBB properties. Some examples of this include the circumventricular organs, the roof of the third and fourth ventricles, capillaries in the pineal gland on the roof of the diencephalon and the pineal gland.[11][12]\n\nDevelopment[edit]\nThe BBB appears to be functional by the time of birth. P-glycoprotein, a transporter, exists already in the embryonal endothelium.[13]\nMeasurement of brain uptake of various blood-borne solutes showed that newborn endothelial cells were functionally similar to those in adults,[14] indicating that a selective BBB is operative at birth.\n\nFunction[edit]\nSee also: Neuroimmune system\nThe blood–brain barrier acts effectively to protect brain tissue from circulating pathogens and other potentially toxic substances.[15] Accordingly, blood-borne infections of the brain are rare.[1] Infections of the brain that do occur are often difficult to treat. Antibodies are too large to cross the blood–brain barrier, and only certain antibiotics are able to pass.[16] In some cases, a drug has to be administered directly into the cerebrospinal fluid where it can enter the brain by crossing the blood-cerebrospinal fluid barrier.[17][18]\n\n[CITATION 2]\nSOURCE: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood%E2%80%93brain_barrier             # Neurophysiology (BBB)\nTITLE: Blood–brain barrier - Wikipedia\nPAGE: \nCHUNK: 500\nSNIPPET: Blood–brain barrier - Wikipedia                               Jump to content        Main menu      Main menu move to sidebar hide    \t\tNavigation \t   Main pageContentsCurrent eventsRandom articleAbout WikipediaContact us      \t\tContribute \t   HelpLearn to editCommunity portalRecent changesUpload fileSpecial pages                    Search            Search                       Appearance                 Donate  Create account  Log in         Personal tools      Donate Create account Log in                             Contents move to sidebar hide     (Top)      1 Structure     Toggle Structure subsection      1.1 Development           2 Function     Toggle Function subsection      2.1 Circumventricular organs         2.2 Specialized permeable zones           3 Therapeutic research     Toggle Therapeutic research subsection      3.1 As a drug target       3.1.1 Intranasal administration         3.1.2 Nanoparticles           3.2 Damage in injury and disease           4 History         5 See also         6 Ref\nCONTENT:\nBlood–brain barrier - Wikipedia\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nJump to content\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMain menu\n\n\n\n\n\nMain menu\nmove to sidebar\nhide\n\n\n\n\t\tNavigation\n\t\n\n\nMain pageContentsCurrent eventsRandom articleAbout WikipediaContact us\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\tContribute\n\t\n\n\nHelpLearn to editCommunity portalRecent changesUpload fileSpecial pages\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSearch\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSearch\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAppearance\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDonate\n\nCreate account\n\nLog in\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPersonal tools\n\n\n\n\n\nDonate Create account Log in\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nContents\nmove to sidebar\nhide\n\n\n\n\n(Top)\n\n\n\n\n\n1\nStructure\n\n\n\n\nToggle Structure subsection\n\n\n\n\n\n1.1\nDevelopment\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n2\nFunction\n\n\n\n\nToggle Function subsection\n\n\n\n\n\n2.1\nCircumventricular organs\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n2.2\nSpecialized permeable zones\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n3\nTherapeutic research\n\n\n\n\nToggle Therapeutic research subsection\n\n\n\n\n\n3.1\nAs a drug target\n\n\n\n\n\n\n3.1.1\nIntranasal administration\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n3.1.2\nNanoparticles\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n3.2\nDamage in injury and disease\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n4\nHistory\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n5\nSee also\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n6\nReferences\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nToggle the table of contents\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBlood–brain barrier\n\n\n\n46 languages\n\n\n\n\nالعربيةবাংলাБеларускаяБългарскиBosanskiCatalàČeštinaDanskDeutschEestiΕλληνικάEspañolEuskaraفارسیFrançaisGaeilgeGalego한국어ՀայերենBahasa IndonesiaÍslenskaItalianoעבריתLatviešuNederlands日本語Norsk bokmålNorsk nynorskOʻzbekcha / ўзбекчаPolskiPortuguêsRomânăРусскийSimple EnglishSlovenčinaSlovenščinaСрпски / srpskiSrpskohrvatski / српскохрватскиSuomiSvenskaไทยTürkçeУкраїнськаTiếng Việt粵語中文\n\nEdit links\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nArticleTalk\n\n\n\n\n\nEnglish\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nReadEditView history\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTools\n\n\n\n\n\nTools\nmove to sidebar\nhide\n\n\n\n\t\tActions\n\t\n\n\nReadEditView history\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\tGeneral\n\t\n\n\nWhat links hereRelated changesUpload filePermanent linkPage informationCite this pageGet shortened URLDownload QR code\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\tPrint/export\n\t\n\n\nDownload as PDFPrintable version\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\tIn other projects\n\t\n\n\nWikimedia CommonsWikidata item\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAppearance\nmove to sidebar\nhide\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFrom Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia\n\n\n\nSemipermeable capillary interface between blood and the brain\n\n[CITATION 3]\nSOURCE: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood%E2%80%93brain_barrier             # Neurophysiology (BBB)\nTITLE: Blood–brain barrier - Wikipedia\nPAGE: \nCHUNK: 504\nSNIPPET: ^ a b c d e Daneman R, Prat A (January 2015).

After a cell receives stimulus, it undergoes organized degradation of cellular organelles by activated proteolytic caspases. In addition to the destruction of cellular organelles, mRNA is rapidly and globally degraded by a mechanism that is not yet fully characterized.[59] mRNA decay is triggered very early in apoptosis.\nA cell undergoing apoptosis shows a series of characteristic morphological changes. Early alterations include:\n\nCell shrinkage and rounding occur because of the two parallel processes: (a) retraction of lamellipodia and the breakdown of the proteinaceous cytoskeleton by caspases.,[60] and (b) water removal deacreasing cytoplasmic diffusion.[61]\nThe cytoplasm appears dense, and the organelles appear tightly packed.[62]\nChromatin undergoes condensation into compact patches against the nuclear envelope (also known as the perinuclear envelope) in a process known as pyknosis, a hallmark of apoptosis.[63][64]\nThe nuclear envelope becomes discontinuous and the DNA inside it is fragmented in a process referred to as karyorrhexis. The nucleus breaks into several discrete chromatin bodies or nucleosomal units due to the degradation of DNA.[65]\nApoptosis progresses quickly and its products are quickly removed, making it difficult to detect or visualize on classical histology sections. During karyorrhexis, endonuclease activation leaves short DNA fragments, regularly spaced in size. These give a characteristic ""laddered"" appearance on agar gel after electrophoresis.[66] Tests for DNA laddering differentiate apoptosis from ischemic or toxic cell death.[67]\n\nApoptotic cell disassembly[edit]\nDifferent steps in apoptotic cell disassembly[68]\nBefore the apoptotic cell is disposed of, there is a process of disassembly. There are three recognized steps in apoptotic cell disassembly:[69]']","Hallmark cellular features of apoptosis include cell shrinkage and rounding, along with the cytoplasm appearing dense with tightly packed organelles. A key characteristic is pyknosis, where chromatin condenses into compact patches against the nuclear envelope, followed by karyorrhexis, which is the fragmentation of DNA and discontinuity of the nuclear envelope. The cell membrane also exhibits irregular buds called blebs and may form protrusions, ultimately leading to the cell breaking apart into apoptotic bodies.","Apoptosis is programmed cell death characterized by cell shrinkage, chromatin condensation, DNA fragmentation, membrane blebbing, and formation of apoptotic bodies that are cleared by phagocytes with minimal inflammation.",0.8571428571428571,0.8354991391739035,0.9999999999,1.0

In contrast, apoptosis is a naturally occurring programmed and targeted cause of cellular death. While apoptosis often provides beneficial effects to the organism, necrosis is almost always detrimental and can be fatal.[3]\nCellular death due to necrosis does not follow the apoptotic signal transduction pathway, but rather various receptors are activated and result in the loss of cell membrane integrity[4] and an uncontrolled release of products of cell death into the extracellular space.[1] This initiates an inflammatory response in the surrounding tissue, which attracts leukocytes and nearby phagocytes which eliminate the dead cells by phagocytosis. However, microbial damaging substances released by leukocytes would create collateral damage to surrounding tissues.[5] This excess collateral damage inhibits the healing process. Thus, untreated necrosis results in a build-up of decomposing dead tissue and cell debris at or near the site of the cell death. A classic example is gangrene. For this reason, it is often necessary to remove necrotic tissue surgically, a procedure known as debridement.[citation needed]\n\n\nClassification[edit]\nStructural signs that indicate irreversible cell injury and the progression of necrosis include dense clumping and progressive disruption of genetic material, and disruption to membranes of cells and organelles.[6]\n\nMorphological patterns[edit]\nThere are six distinctive morphological patterns of necrosis:[7]\n\n[CITATION 2]\nSOURCE: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Necrosis                                # Cell biology / Pathology (necrosis)\nTITLE: Necrosis - Wikipedia\nPAGE: \nCHUNK: 543\nSNIPPET: ^ Nirmala JG, Lopus M (April 2020).

For example, the differentiation of fingers and toes in a developing human embryo occurs because cells between the fingers apoptose; the result is that the digits are separate. PCD serves fundamental functions during both plant and animal tissue development.\nApoptosis and autophagy are both forms of programmed cell death.[6] Necrosis is the death of a cell caused by external factors such as trauma or infection and occurs in several different forms. Necrosis was long seen as a non-physiological process that occurs as a result of infection or injury,[6] but in the 2000s, a form of programmed necrosis, called necroptosis,[7] was recognized as an alternative form of programmed cell death. It is hypothesized that necroptosis can serve as a cell-death backup to apoptosis when the apoptosis signaling is blocked by endogenous or exogenous factors such as viruses or mutations. Most recently, other types of regulated necrosis have been discovered as well, which share several signaling events with necroptosis and apoptosis.[8]\n\n\nHistory[edit]\nThe concept of ""programmed cell-death"" was used by Lockshin & Williams[9] in 1964 in relation to insect tissue development, around eight years before ""apoptosis"" was coined. The term PCD has, however, been a source of confusion and Durand and Ramsey[10] have developed the concept by providing mechanistic and evolutionary definitions. PCD has become the general terms that refers to all the different types of cell death that have a genetic component.[citation needed][11]\nThe first insight into the mechanism came from studying BCL2, the product of a putative oncogene activated by chromosome translocations often found in follicular lymphoma. Unlike other cancer genes, which promote cancer by stimulating cell proliferation, BCL2 promoted cancer by stopping lymphoma cells from being able to kill themselves.[12]\nPCD has been the subject of increasing attention and research efforts. This trend has been highlighted with the award of the 2002 Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine to Sydney Brenner (United Kingdom), H. Robert Horvitz (US) and John E. Sulston (UK).[13]\n\nTypes[edit]\nOverview of signal transduction pathways involved in apoptosis\nApoptosis or Type I cell-death.\nAutophagic cell death or Type II cell-death. (Cytoplasmic: characterized by the formation of large vacuoles that eat away organelles in a specific sequence prior to the destruction of the nucleus.)[14]\nApoptosis[edit]\nApoptosis is the process of programmed cell death (PCD) that may occur in multicellular organisms.[15] Biochemical events lead to characteristic cell changes (morphology) and death. These changes include blebbing, cell shrinkage, nuclear fragmentation, chromatin condensation, and chromosomal DNA fragmentation. It is now thought that -- in a developmental context -- cells are induced to positively commit suicide whilst in a homeostatic context; the absence of certain survival factors may provide the impetus for suicide. There appears to be some variation in the morphology and indeed the biochemistry of these suicide pathways; some treading the path of ""apoptosis"", others following a more generalized pathway to deletion, but both usually being genetically and synthetically motivated. There is some evidence that certain symptoms of ""apoptosis"" such as endonuclease activation can be spuriously induced without engaging a genetic cascade, however, presumably true apoptosis and programmed cell death must be genetically mediated. It is also becoming clear that mitosis and apoptosis are toggled or linked in some way and that the balance achieved depends on signals received from appropriate growth or survival factors.[16]\n\nExtrinsic vs. intrinsic pathways[edit]\nThere are two different potential pathways that may be followed when apoptosis is needed. There is the extrinsic pathway and the intrinsic pathway. Both pathways involve the use of caspases - crucial to cell death.[17]\n\n[CITATION 3]\nSOURCE: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Programmed_cell_death                   # Cell biology (PCD overview)\nTITLE: Programmed cell death - Wikipedia\nPAGE: \nCHUNK: 556\nSNIPPET: ^ a b c Kierszenbaum A (2012).

The receptor molecule contains an α- and β subunits. Two molecules are joined to form what is known as a homodimer. Insulin binds to the α-subunits of the homodimer, which faces the extracellular side of the cells. The β subunits have tyrosine kinase enzyme activity which is triggered by the insulin binding. This activity provokes the autophosphorylation of the β subunits and subsequently the phosphorylation of proteins inside the cell known as insulin receptor substrates (IRS). The phosphorylation of the IRS activates a signal transduction cascade that leads to the activation of other kinases as well as transcription factors that mediate the intracellular effects of insulin.[66]\nThe cascade that leads to the insertion of GLUT4 glucose transporters into the cell membranes of muscle and fat cells, and to the synthesis of glycogen in liver and muscle tissue, as well as the conversion of glucose into triglycerides in liver, adipose, and lactating mammary gland tissue, operates via the activation, by IRS-1, of phosphoinositol 3 kinase (PI3K). This enzyme converts a phospholipid in the cell membrane by the name of phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate (PIP2), into phosphatidylinositol 3,4,5-triphosphate (PIP3), which, in turn, activates protein kinase B (PKB). Activated PKB facilitates the fusion of GLUT4 containing endosomes with the cell membrane, resulting in an increase in GLUT4 transporters in the plasma membrane.[67] PKB also phosphorylates glycogen synthase kinase (GSK), thereby inactivating this enzyme.[68] This means that its substrate, glycogen synthase (GS), cannot be phosphorylated, and remains dephosphorylated, and therefore active. The active enzyme, glycogen synthase (GS), catalyzes the rate limiting step in the synthesis of glycogen from glucose. Similar dephosphorylations affect the enzymes controlling the rate of glycolysis leading to the synthesis of fats via malonyl-CoA in the tissues that can generate triglycerides, and also the enzymes that control the rate of gluconeogenesis in the liver. The overall effect of these final enzyme dephosphorylations is that, in the tissues that can carry out these reactions, glycogen and fat synthesis from glucose are stimulated, and glucose production by the liver through glycogenolysis and gluconeogenesis are inhibited.[69] The breakdown of triglycerides by adipose tissue into free fatty acids and glycerol is also inhibited.[69]\nAfter the intracellular signal that resulted from the binding of insulin to its receptor has been produced, termination of signaling is then needed.  As mentioned below in the section on degradation, endocytosis and degradation of the receptor bound to insulin is a main mechanism to end signaling.[41]  In addition, the signaling pathway is also terminated by dephosphorylation of the tyrosine residues in the various signaling pathways by tyrosine phosphatases.  Serine/Threonine kinases are also known to reduce the activity of insulin.\nThe structure of the insulin–insulin receptor complex has been determined using the techniques of X-ray crystallography.[70]\n\nPhysiological effects[edit]\nEffect of insulin on glucose uptake and metabolism. Insulin binds to its receptor (1), which starts many protein activation cascades (2). These include translocation of Glut-4 transporter to the plasma membrane and influx of glucose (3), glycogen synthesis (4), glycolysis (5) and triglyceride synthesis (6).\nThe insulin signal transduction pathway begins when insulin binds to the insulin receptor proteins. Once the transduction pathway is completed, the GLUT-4 storage vesicles becomes one with the cellular membrane. As a result, the GLUT-4 protein channels become embedded into the membrane, allowing glucose to be transported into the cell.\nThe actions of insulin on the global human metabolism level include:\n\nIncrease of cellular intake of certain substances, most prominently glucose in muscle and adipose tissue (about two-thirds of body cells)[71]\nIncrease of DNA replication and protein synthesis via control of amino acid uptake\nModification of the activity of numerous enzymes.\nThe actions of insulin (indirect and direct) on cells include:\n\n[CITATION 3]\nSOURCE: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Insulin                                 # Endocrinology (insulin)\nTITLE: Insulin - Wikipedia\nPAGE: \nCHUNK: 578\nSNIPPET: Stimulates the uptake of glucose –  Insulin decreases blood glucose concentration by inducing intake of glucose by the cells.

At the same time, insulin inhibits the enzyme glucose-6-phosphatase, which removes the phosphate group. These two enzymes are key for the formation of glycogen. Also, insulin activates the enzymes phosphofructokinase and glycogen synthase which are responsible for glycogen synthesis.[72]\nDecreased gluconeogenesis and glycogenolysis – decreases production of glucose from noncarbohydrate substrates, primarily in the liver (the vast majority of endogenous insulin arriving at the liver never leaves the liver); decrease of insulin causes glucose production by the liver from assorted substrates.[71]\nDecreased proteolysis – decreasing the breakdown of protein[71]\nDecreased autophagy – decreased level of degradation of damaged organelles. Postprandial levels inhibit autophagy completely.[73]\nIncreased amino acid uptake – forces cells to absorb circulating amino acids; decrease of insulin inhibits absorption.[71]\nArterial muscle tone – forces arterial wall muscle to relax, increasing blood flow, especially in microarteries; decrease of insulin reduces flow by allowing these muscles to contract.[74]\nIncrease in the secretion of hydrochloric acid by parietal cells in the stomach.[citation needed]\nIncreased potassium uptake – forces cells synthesizing glycogen (a very spongy, ""wet"" substance, that increases the content of intracellular water, and its accompanying K+ ions)[75] to absorb potassium from the extracellular fluids; lack of insulin inhibits absorption. Insulin\'s increase in cellular potassium uptake lowers potassium levels in blood plasma.  This possibly occurs via insulin-induced translocation of the Na+/K+-ATPase to the surface of skeletal muscle cells.[76][77]\nDecreased renal sodium excretion.[78]\nIn hepatocytes, insulin binding acutely leads to activation of protein phosphatase 2A (PP2A)[citation needed], which dephosphorylates the bifunctional enzyme fructose bisphosphatase-2 (PFKB1),[79] activating the phosphofructokinase-2 (PFK-2) active site. PFK-2 increases production of fructose 2,6-bisphosphate. Fructose 2,6-bisphosphate allosterically activates PFK-1, which favors glycolysis over gluconeogenesis. Increased glycolysis increases the formation of malonyl-CoA, a molecule that can be shunted into lipogenesis and that allosterically inhibits of  carnitine palmitoyltransferase I (CPT1), a mitochondrial enzyme necessary for the translocation of fatty acids into the intermembrane space of the mitochondria for fatty acid metabolism.[80]\nInsulin also influences other body functions, such as vascular compliance and cognition. Once insulin enters the human brain, it enhances learning and memory and benefits verbal memory in particular.[81] Enhancing brain insulin signaling by means of intranasal insulin administration also enhances the acute thermoregulatory and glucoregulatory response to food intake, suggesting that central nervous insulin contributes to the co-ordination of a wide variety of homeostatic or regulatory processes in the human body.[82] Insulin also has stimulatory effects on gonadotropin-releasing hormone from the hypothalamus, thus favoring fertility.[83]']","Insulin lowers blood glucose in muscle and adipose tissue by binding to its receptor, initiating a signal transduction cascade.

Insulin, which lowers blood sugar, and glucagon, which raises it, are the most well known of the hormones involved, but more recent discoveries of other glucoregulatory hormones have expanded the understanding of this process. The gland called pancreas secretes two hormones and they are primarily responsible to regulate glucose levels in blood.[1]\n\nMechanisms[edit]\nThe flat line is the optimal blood sugar level (i.e. the homeostatic set point). Blood sugar levels are balanced by the tug-of-war between 2 functionally opposite hormones, glucagon and insulin.\nBlood sugar levels are regulated by negative feedback in order to keep the body in balance.[2][3][4][5] The levels of glucose in the blood are monitored by many tissues, but the cells in the pancreatic islets are among the most well understood and important.[citation needed]\nGranule docking is an important glucose-dependent step in human insulin secretion that does not work properly in type 2 diabetes.[6]\n\nGlucagon[edit]\nIf the blood glucose level falls to dangerously low levels (as during very heavy exercise or lack of food for extended periods), the alpha cells of the pancreas release glucagon, a peptide  hormone which travels through the blood to  the liver, where it binds to glucagon receptors on the surface of liver cells and stimulates them to break down glycogen stored inside the cells into glucose (this process is called glycogenolysis).  The cells release the glucose into the bloodstream, increasing blood sugar levels. Hypoglycemia, the state of having low blood sugar, is treated by restoring the blood glucose level to normal by the ingestion or administration of dextrose or carbohydrate foods. It is often self-diagnosed and self-medicated orally by the ingestion of balanced meals. In more severe circumstances, it is treated by injection or infusion of glucagon.[citation needed]\n\n[CITATION 2]\nSOURCE: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood_sugar_regulation                  # Endocrinology / Physiology (glucose regulation)\nTITLE: Blood sugar regulation - Wikipedia\nPAGE: \nCHUNK: 610\nSNIPPET: Insulin[edit] When levels of blood sugar rise, whether as a result of glycogen conversion, or from digestion of a meal, a different hormone is released from beta cells found in the islets of Langerhans in the pancreas. This hormone, insulin, causes the liver to convert more glucose into glycogen (this process is called glycogenesis), and to force about 2/3 of body cells (primarily muscle and fat tissue cells) to take up glucose from the blood through the GLUT4 transporter, thus decreasing blood sugar. When insulin binds to the receptors on the cell surface, vesicles containing the GLUT4 transporters come to the plasma membrane and fuse together by the process of endocytosis, thus enabling a facilitated diffusion of glucose into the cell.

Among them are the \'stress\' hormones such as epinephrine (also known as adrenaline), several of the steroids, infections, trauma, and of course, the ingestion of food.[citation needed]\nDiabetes mellitus type 1 is caused by insufficient or non-existent production of insulin, while type 2 is primarily due to a decreased response to insulin in the tissues of the body (insulin resistance). Both types of diabetes, if untreated, result in too much glucose remaining in the blood (hyperglycemia) and many of the same complications.  Also, too much insulin and/or exercise without enough corresponding food intake in diabetics can result in low blood sugar (hypoglycemia).[citation needed]\n\nHormones that influence blood glucose level[edit]\n\n\nHormone\n\nTissue of origin\n\nMetabolic effect\n\nEffect on blood glucose\n\n\nInsulin\n\nPancreatic β Cells\n\n1) Enhances entry of glucose into cells; 2) Enhances storage of glucose as glycogen, or conversion to fatty acids; 3) Enhances synthesis of fatty acids and proteins; 4) Suppresses breakdown of proteins into amino acids, and Triglycerides (from adipose tissue) into free fatty acids.\n\nLowers\n\n\nAmylin[1]\n\nPancreatic β Cells\n\n1) Suppresses glucagon secretion after eating; 2) Slows gastric emptying; 3) Reduces food intake.\n\nLowers\n\n\nGLP-1[1]\n\nIntestinal L cells\n\n1) Enhances glucose-dependent insulin secretion; 2) Suppresses glucagon secretion after eating; 3) Slows gastric emptying; 4) Reduces food intake.

In its narrowest definition, immunotherapy refers to treatments designed to stimulate or guide the immune system to recognize and fight cancer, often by enhancing or restoring immune responses to eradicate malignant cells while sparing healthy tissue.[1][2][3]\nA broader definition of immunotherapy applies beyond oncology, including strategies to stimulate or suppress immune activity against other diseases such as autoimmune disorders, infectious diseases, and allergies. These approaches may involve vaccines, immune modulators, or monoclonal antibodies designed to alter immune responses, either to boost protection against pathogens or to reduce damaging inflammation.[4][5]\nImmunotherapy includes both passive methods, like monoclonal antibodies that mark abnormal cells for immune destruction, and active methods, such as cancer vaccines, immune checkpoint inhibitors, adoptive cell transfer, and cytokine therapies. Advances in immunotherapy have transformed the treatment landscape for cancer and are increasingly applied to a wider range of conditions, improving outcomes for many patients, though responses can vary depending on disease type, genetic background, and environmental factors.[2][3][6][7][8]\nCell-based immunotherapies are effective for some cancers.[9][10] Immune effector cells such as lymphocytes, macrophages, dendritic cells, natural killer cells, and cytotoxic T lymphocytes work together to defend the body against cancer by targeting abnormal antigens expressed on the surface of tumor cells. Vaccine-induced immunity to COVID-19 relies mostly on an immunomodulatory T-cell response.[11]\nTherapies such as granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (G-CSF), interferons, imiquimod and cellular membrane fractions from bacteria are licensed for medical use. Others including IL-2, IL-7, IL-12, various chemokines, synthetic cytosine phosphate-guanosine (CpG) oligodeoxynucleotides and glucans are involved in clinical and preclinical studies.\n\n\nImmunomodulators[edit]\nImmunomodulators are the active agents of immunotherapy.

In 2018 the Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine was awarded to James P. Allison and Tasuku Honjo ""for their discovery of cancer therapy by inhibition of negative immune regulation."" Cancer immunotherapy attempts to stimulate the immune system to destroy tumours. A variety of strategies are in use or are undergoing research and testing. Randomized controlled studies in different cancers resulting in significant increase in survival and disease free period have been reported[17] and its efficacy is enhanced by 20–30% when cell-based immunotherapy is combined with conventional treatment methods.[17]\nOne of the oldest forms of cancer immunotherapy is the use of BCG vaccine, which was originally to vaccinate against tuberculosis and later was found to be useful in the treatment of bladder cancer.[18] BCG immunotherapy induces both local and systemic immune responses. The mechanisms by which BCG immunotherapy mediates tumor immunity have been widely studied, but they are still not completely understood.[19]\nThe use of monoclonal antibodies in cancer therapy was first introduced in 1997 with rituximab, an anti-CD20 antibody for treatment of B cell lymphoma.[20] Since then several monoclonal antibodies have been approved for treatment of various haematological malignancies as well as for solid tumours.[21][22]\nThe extraction of G-CSF lymphocytes from the blood and expanding in vitro against a tumour antigen before reinjecting the cells with appropriate stimulatory cytokines. The cells then destroy the tumour cells that express the antigen.[23] Topical immunotherapy utilizes an immune enhancement cream (imiquimod) which produces interferon, causing the recipient\'s killer T cells to destroy warts,[24] actinic keratoses, basal cell cancer, vaginal intraepithelial neoplasia,[25] squamous cell cancer,[26][27] cutaneous lymphoma,[28] and superficial melanoma.[29] Injection immunotherapy (""intralesional"" or ""intratumoural"") uses mumps, candida, the HPV vaccine[30][31] or trichophytin antigen injections to treat warts (HPV induced tumours).\nAdoptive cell transfer has been tested on lung[32] and other cancers, with greatest success achieved in melanoma.\n\nDendritic cell-based pump-priming or vaccination[edit]\nDendritic cells (DC) can be stimulated to activate a cytotoxic response towards an antigen. Dendritic cells, a type of antigen-presenting cell, are harvested from the person needing the immunotherapy. These cells are then either pulsed with an antigen or tumour lysate or transfected with a viral vector, causing them to display the antigen. Upon transfusion into the person, these activated cells present the antigen to the effector lymphocytes (CD4+ helper T cells, cytotoxic CD8+ T cells and B cells). This initiates a cytotoxic response against tumour cells expressing the antigen (against which the adaptive response has now been primed). The first FDA-approved cell-based immunotherapy,[33] the cancer vaccine Sipuleucel-T is one example of this approach.[34] The Immune Response Corporation[35] (IRC) developed this immunotherapy and licensed the technology to Dendreon, which obtained FDA clearance.\nThe current approaches for DC-based vaccination are mainly based on antigen loading on in vitro-generated DCs from monocytes or CD34+ cells, activating them with different TLR ligands, cytokine combinations, and injecting them back to the patients. The in vivo targeting approaches comprise administering specific cytokines (e.g., Flt3L, GM-CSF) and targeting the DCs with antibodies to C-type lectin receptors or agonistic antibodies (e.g., anti-CD40) that are conjugated with antigen of interest. Multiple, next-generation anti-CD40 platforms are being actively developed.[36] Future approach may target DC subsets based on their specifically expressed C-type lectin receptors or chemokine receptors. Another potential approach is the generation of genetically engineered DCs from induced pluripotent stem cells and use of neoantigen-loaded DCs for inducing better clinical outcome.[37]\n\n[CITATION 3]\nSOURCE: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immunotherapy                           # Immunology / Oncology (immunotherapy)\nTITLE: Immunotherapy - Wikipedia\nPAGE: \nCHUNK: 632\nSNIPPET: Immunotherapy - Wikipedia                            Jump to content        Main menu      Main menu move to sidebar hide    \t\tNavigation \t   Main pageContentsCurrent eventsRandom articleAbout WikipediaContact us      \t\tContribute \t   HelpLearn to editCommunity portalRecent changesUpload fileSpecial pages                    Search            Search                       Appearance                 Donate  Create account  Log in         Personal tools      Donate Create account Log in                             Contents move to sidebar hide     (Top)      1 Immunomodulators         2 Activation immunotherapies     Toggle Activation immunotherapies subsection      2.1 Cancer       2.1.1 Dendritic cell-based pump-priming or vaccination         2.1.2 Adoptive cell therapy         2.1.3 Checkpoint inhibitors             3 Immune enhancement therapy         4 Suppression immunotherapies     Toggle Suppression immunotherapies subsection      4.1 Immunosuppressive drugs         4.2 Immune tolerance         4.3 Allerg\nCONTENT:\nImmunotherapy - Wikipedia\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nJump to content\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMain menu\n\n\n\n\n\nMain menu\nmove to sidebar\nhide\n\n\n\n\t\tNavigation\n\t\n\n\nMain pageContentsCurrent eventsRandom articleAbout WikipediaContact us\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\tContribute\n\t\n\n\nHelpLearn to editCommunity portalRecent changesUpload fileSpecial pages\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSearch\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSearch\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAppearance\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDonate\n\nCreate account\n\nLog in\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPersonal tools\n\n\n\n\n\nDonate Create account Log in\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nContents\nmove to sidebar\nhide\n\n\n\n\n(Top)\n\n\n\n\n\n1\nImmunomodulators\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n2\nActivation immunotherapies\n\n\n\n\nToggle Activation immunotherapies subsection\n\n\n\n\n\n2.1\nCancer\n\n\n\n\n\n\n2.1.1\nDendritic cell-based pump-priming or vaccination\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n2.1.2\nAdoptive cell therapy\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n2.1.3\nCheckpoint inhibitors\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n3\nImmune enhancement therapy\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n4\nSuppression immunotherapies\n\n\n\n\nToggle Suppression immunotherapies subsection\n\n\n\n\n\n4.1\nImmunosuppressive drugs\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n4.2\nImmune tolerance\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n4.3\nAllergen immunotherapy\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n5\nHelminthic therapies\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n6\nSee also\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n7\nReferences\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n8\nExternal links\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nToggle the table of contents\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nImmunotherapy\n\n\n\n38 languages\n\n\n\n\nالعربيةAragonésБългарскиBosanskiCatalàČeštinaDeutschEestiΕλληνικάEspañolEuskaraفارسیFrançaisGalego한국어Bahasa IndonesiaItalianoעבריתҚазақшаКыргызчаLombardMagyarNederlands日本語Norsk bokmålOʻzbekcha / ўзбекчаPolskiPortuguêsRomânăРусскийSimple EnglishSuomiSvenskaதமிழ்TürkçeУкраїнськаاردو中文\n\nEdit links\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nArticleTalk\n\n\n\n\n\nEnglish\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nReadEditView history\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTools\n\n\n\n\n\nTools\nmove to sidebar\nhide\n\n\n\n\t\tActions\n\t\n\n\nReadEditView history\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\tGeneral\n\t\n\n\nWhat links hereRelated changesUpload filePermanent linkPage informationCite this pageGet shortened URLDownload QR code\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\tPrint/export\n\t\n\n\nDownload as PDFPrintable version\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\tIn other projects\n\t\n\n\nWikimedia CommonsWikidata item\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAppearance\nmove to sidebar\nhide\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFrom Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia\n\n\n\nActivation or suppression of the immune system to treat disease\nThis article is about immunotherapy in general.

Molecular weights of the various penicillinases tend to cluster near 50 kilodaltons.\nPenicillinase was the first β-lactamase to be identified. It was first isolated by Abraham and Chain in 1940 from E. coli (which are gram-negative) even before penicillin entered clinical use,[5] but penicillinase production quickly spread to bacteria that previously did not produce it or produced it only rarely.  Penicillinase-resistant beta-lactams such as methicillin were developed, but there is now widespread resistance to even these.\n\nResistance in gram-negative bacteria[edit]\nThis section may require cleanup to meet Wikipedia\'s quality standards. The specific problem is: confusing mix of structural and functional classifications; need explanatory paragraph on what these classes are. Please help improve this section if you can. (September 2021) (Learn how and when to remove this message)\nAmong gram-negative bacteria, the emergence of resistance to extended-spectrum cephalosporins has been a major concern. It appeared initially in a limited number of bacterial species (E. cloacae, C. freundii, S. marcescens, and P. aeruginosa) that could mutate to hyperproduce their chromosomal class C β-lactamase. A few years later, resistance appeared in bacterial species not naturally producing AmpC enzymes (K. pneumoniae, Salmonella spp., P. mirabilis) due to the production of TEM- or SHV-type ESBLs (extended spectrum beta lactamases). Characteristically, such resistance has included oxyimino- (for example ceftizoxime, cefotaxime, ceftriaxone, and ceftazidime, as well as the oxyimino-monobactam aztreonam), but not 7-alpha-methoxy-cephalosporins (cephamycins; in other words, cefoxitin and cefotetan); has been blocked by inhibitors such as clavulanate, sulbactam or tazobactam and did not involve carbapenems and temocillin. Chromosomal-mediated AmpC β-lactamases represent a new threat, since they confer resistance to 7-alpha-methoxy-cephalosporins (cephamycins) such as cefoxitin or cefotetan but are not affected by commercially available β-lactamase inhibitors, and can, in strains with loss of outer membrane porins, provide resistance to carbapenems.[6]\n\n[CITATION 2]\nSOURCE: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Beta-lactamase                          # Microbiology / Resistance mechanism (β-lactamase)\nTITLE: Beta-lactamase - Wikipedia\nPAGE: \nCHUNK: 653\nSNIPPET: Wikimedia CommonsWikidata item                      Appearance move to sidebar hide           From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia    Class of enzymes   Protein family Serine beta-lactamaseStructure of Streptomyces albus beta-lactamaseIdentifiersSymbolβ-lactamase domainPfamPF00144Pfam clanCL0013InterProIPR001466PROSITEPS00146SCOP256601 / SCOPe / SUPFAMAvailable protein structures:PDB  \xa01axb\u200b, 1blp\u200b, 1bsg\u200b, 1bue\u200b, 1e25\u200b, 1ghi\u200b, 1i2s\u200b, 1n9b\u200b, 1ong\u200b, 2cc1\u200b, 2gdn\u200b, 3dwz\u200b IPR001466 PF00144 (ECOD; PDBsum)  \xa0AlphaFoldIPR001466PF00144 Protein family Metallo-beta-lactamaseMetallo-beta-lactamase L1 homotetramer, StenotrophomonasIdentifiersSymbol?PfamPF00753Pfam clanCL0381InterProIPR001279Available protein structures:PDB  \xa0IPR001279 PF00753 (ECOD; PDBsum)  \xa0AlphaFoldIPR001279PF00753 β-lactamaseAction of β-lactamase and decarboxylation of the intermediateIdentifiersEC no.3.5.2.6CAS no.9073-60-3 DatabasesIntEnzIntEnz viewBRENDABRENDA entryExPASyNiceZyme viewKEGGKEGG entryMetaCycmetabolic pathwayPRIAMprofilePDB structures\nCONTENT:\nWikimedia CommonsWikidata item\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAppearance\nmove to sidebar\nhide\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFrom Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia\n\n\n\nClass of enzymes\n\n\nProtein family\nSerine beta-lactamaseStructure of Streptomyces albus beta-lactamaseIdentifiersSymbolβ-lactamase domainPfamPF00144Pfam clanCL0013InterProIPR001466PROSITEPS00146SCOP256601 / SCOPe / SUPFAMAvailable protein structures:PDB\n \xa01axb\u200b, 1blp\u200b, 1bsg\u200b, 1bue\u200b, 1e25\u200b, 1ghi\u200b, 1i2s\u200b, 1n9b\u200b, 1ong\u200b, 2cc1\u200b, 2gdn\u200b, 3dwz\u200b IPR001466 PF00144 (ECOD; PDBsum)\n \xa0AlphaFoldIPR001466PF00144\nProtein family\nMetallo-beta-lactamaseMetallo-beta-lactamase L1 homotetramer, StenotrophomonasIdentifiersSymbol?PfamPF00753Pfam clanCL0381InterProIPR001279Available protein structures:PDB\n \xa0IPR001279 PF00753 (ECOD; PDBsum)\n \xa0AlphaFoldIPR001279PF00753\nβ-lactamaseAction of β-lactamase and decarboxylation of the intermediateIdentifiersEC no.3.5.2.6CAS no.9073-60-3 DatabasesIntEnzIntEnz viewBRENDABRENDA entryExPASyNiceZyme viewKEGGKEGG entryMetaCycmetabolic pathwayPRIAMprofilePDB structuresRCSB PDB PDBe PDBsumGene OntologyAmiGO  / QuickGOSearchPMCarticlesPubMedarticlesNCBIproteins\nCore structure of penicillins (top) and cephalosporins (bottom).

E. coli bacteria on the left are resistant to beta-lactam antibiotics, and grow next to one antibiotic (bottom) and are less inhibited by another antibiotic (top).\nBeta-lactamases (β-lactamases)  are enzymes (EC 3.5.2.6) produced by bacteria that provide multi-resistance to beta-lactam antibiotics such as penicillins, cephalosporins, cephamycins, monobactams and carbapenems (ertapenem), although carbapenems are relatively resistant to beta-lactamase. Beta-lactamase provides antibiotic resistance by breaking the antibiotics\' structure. These antibiotics all have a common element in their molecular structure: a four-atom ring known as a beta-lactam (β-lactam) ring. Through hydrolysis, the enzyme lactamase breaks the β-lactam ring open, deactivating the molecule\'s antibacterial properties. \nBeta-lactamases produced by gram-negative bacteria are usually secreted, especially when antibiotics are present in the environment.[1]\n\n\nStructure[edit]\nThe structure of a Streptomyces serine β-lactamase (SBLs) is given by 1BSG. The alpha-beta fold (InterPro:\xa0IPR012338) resembles that of a DD-transpeptidase, from which the enzyme is thought to have evolved. β-lactam antibiotics bind to DD-transpeptidases to inhibit bacterial cell wall biosynthesis. Serine β-lactamases are grouped by sequence similarity into types A, C, and D.\nThe other type of beta-lactamase is of the metallo type (""type B""). Metallo-beta-lactamases (MBLs) need metal ion(s) (1 or 2 Zn2+ ions[2]) on their active site for their catalytic activities.[3] The structure of the New Delhi metallo-beta-lactamase 1 is given by 6C89. It resembles a RNase Z, from which it is thought to have evolved.\n\n[CITATION 3]\nSOURCE: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Beta-lactamase                          # Microbiology / Resistance mechanism (β-lactamase)\nTITLE: Beta-lactamase - Wikipedia\nPAGE: \nCHUNK: 661\nSNIPPET: Evolution[edit] Beta-lactamases are ancient bacterial enzymes.

Groups A and D are sister taxa and group C diverged before A and D.[55] These serine-based enzymes, like the group B betalactamases, are of ancient origin and are theorized to have evolved about two billion years ago.[56]\nThe OXA group (in class D) in particular is theorized to have evolved on chromosomes and moved to plasmids on at least two separate occasions.[57]\n\nEtymology[edit]\nThe ""β"" (beta) refers to the nitrogen\'s position on the second carbon in the ring. Lactam is a blend of lactone (from the Latin lactis, milk, since lactic acid was isolated from soured milk) and amide. The suffix -ase, indicating an enzyme, is derived from diastase (from the Greek diastasis, ""separation""), the first enzyme discovered in 1833 by Payen and Persoz.[58]\n\nSee also[edit]\nβ-lactamase inhibitor\nESBL-producing E. coli\nNitrocefin\nAntimicrobial resistance\nReferences[edit]\n\n\n^ Bush K (2018).

PCR was invented in 1983 by American biochemist Kary Mullis at Cetus Corporation. Mullis and biochemist Michael Smith, who had developed other essential ways of manipulating DNA, were jointly awarded the Nobel Prize in Chemistry in 1993.[1]\nPCR is fundamental to many of the procedures used in genetic testing, research, including analysis of ancient samples of DNA and identification of infectious agents. Using PCR, copies of very small amounts of DNA sequences are exponentially amplified in a series of cycles of temperature changes. PCR is now a common and often indispensable technique used in medical laboratory research for a broad variety of applications including biomedical research and forensic science.[2][3]\nThe majority of PCR methods rely on thermal cycling. Thermal cycling exposes reagents to repeated cycles of heating and cooling to permit different temperature-dependent reactions—specifically, DNA melting and enzyme-driven DNA replication. PCR employs two main reagents—primers (which are short single strand DNA fragments known as oligonucleotides that are a complementary sequence to the target DNA region) and a thermostable DNA polymerase. In the first step of PCR, the two strands of the DNA double helix are physically separated at a high temperature in a process called nucleic acid denaturation. In the second step, the temperature is lowered and the primers bind to the complementary sequences of DNA. The two DNA strands then become templates for DNA polymerase to enzymatically assemble a new DNA strand from free nucleotides, the building blocks of DNA. As PCR progresses, the DNA generated is itself used as a template for replication, setting in motion a chain reaction in which the original DNA template is exponentially amplified.[4]\nAlmost all PCR applications employ a heat-stable DNA polymerase, such as Taq polymerase, an enzyme originally isolated from the thermophilic bacterium Thermus aquaticus. If the polymerase used was heat-susceptible, it would denature under the high temperatures of the denaturation step. Before the use of Taq polymerase, DNA polymerase had to be manually added every cycle, which was a tedious and costly process.[5]\nApplications of the technique include DNA cloning for sequencing, gene cloning and manipulation, gene mutagenesis; construction of DNA-based phylogenies, or functional analysis of genes; diagnosis and monitoring of genetic disorders; amplification of ancient DNA;[6] analysis of genetic fingerprints for DNA profiling (for example, in forensic science and parentage testing); and detection of pathogens in nucleic acid tests for the diagnosis of infectious diseases.\n\n\nPrinciples[edit]\nAn older, three-temperature thermal cycler for PCR\nPCR amplifies a specific region of a DNA strand (the DNA target). Most PCR methods amplify DNA fragments of between 0.1 and 10 kilo-base pairs (kbp) in length, although some techniques allow for amplification of fragments up to 40 kbp.[7] The amount of amplified product is determined by the available substrates in the reaction, which becomes limiting as the reaction progresses.[8]\nA basic PCR set-up requires several components and reagents,[9] including:\n\n[CITATION 2]\nSOURCE: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polymerase_chain_reaction               # Molecular biology / Methods (PCR)\nTITLE: Polymerase chain reaction - Wikipedia\nPAGE: \nCHUNK: 675\nSNIPPET: The human immunodeficiency virus (or HIV), is a difficult target to find and eradicate.

PCR-based tests have allowed detection of small numbers of disease organisms (both live or dead), in convenient samples.  Detailed genetic analysis can also be used to detect antibiotic resistance, allowing immediate and effective therapy.  The effects of therapy can also be immediately evaluated.\nThe spread of a disease organism through populations of domestic or wild animals can be monitored by PCR testing.  In many cases, the appearance of new virulent sub-types can be detected and monitored.  The sub-types of an organism that were responsible for earlier epidemics can also be determined by PCR analysis.\nViral DNA can be detected by PCR. The primers used must be specific to the targeted sequences in the DNA of a virus, and PCR can be used for diagnostic analyses or DNA sequencing of the viral genome. The high sensitivity of PCR permits virus detection soon after infection and even before the onset of disease.[42] Such early detection may give physicians a significant lead time in treatment. The amount of virus (""viral load"") in a patient can also be quantified by PCR-based DNA quantitation techniques (see below). A variant of PCR (RT-PCR) is used for detecting viral RNA rather than DNA: in this test the enzyme reverse transcriptase is used to generate a DNA sequence which matches the viral RNA; this DNA is then amplified as per the usual PCR method. RT-PCR is widely used to detect the SARS-CoV-2 viral genome.[45]\nDiseases such as pertussis (or whooping cough) are caused by the bacteria Bordetella pertussis. This bacteria is marked by a serious acute respiratory infection that affects various animals and humans and has led to the deaths of many young children. The pertussis toxin is a protein exotoxin that binds to cell receptors by two dimers and reacts with different cell types such as T lymphocytes which play a role in cell immunity.[46] PCR is an important testing tool that can detect sequences within the gene for the pertussis toxin.  Because PCR has a high sensitivity for the toxin and a rapid turnaround time, it is very efficient for diagnosing pertussis when compared to culture.[47]\nForensic applications[edit]\nThe development of PCR-based genetic (or DNA) fingerprinting protocols has seen widespread application in forensics:\n\n[CITATION 3]\nSOURCE: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polymerase_chain_reaction               # Molecular biology / Methods (PCR)\nTITLE: Polymerase chain reaction - Wikipedia\nPAGE: \nCHUNK: 668\nSNIPPET: Polymerase chain reaction - Wikipedia                               Jump to content        Main menu      Main menu move to sidebar hide    \t\tNavigation \t   Main pageContentsCurrent eventsRandom articleAbout WikipediaContact us      \t\tContribute \t   HelpLearn to editCommunity portalRecent changesUpload fileSpecial pages                    Search            Search                       Appearance                 Donate  Create account  Log in         Personal tools      Donate Create account Log in                             Contents move to sidebar hide     (Top)      1 Principles     Toggle Principles subsection      1.1 Procedure         1.2 Stages           2 Optimization         3 Applications     Toggle Applications subsection      3.1 Selective DNA isolation         3.2 Amplification and quantification of DNA         3.3 Medical and diagnostic applications         3.4 Infectious disease applications         3.5 Forensic applications         3.6 Research applications           4 Advantages         5 Lim\nCONTENT:\nPolymerase chain reaction - Wikipedia\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nJump to content\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMain menu\n\n\n\n\n\nMain menu\nmove to sidebar\nhide\n\n\n\n\t\tNavigation\n\t\n\n\nMain pageContentsCurrent eventsRandom articleAbout WikipediaContact us\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\tContribute\n\t\n\n\nHelpLearn to editCommunity portalRecent changesUpload fileSpecial pages\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSearch\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSearch\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAppearance\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDonate\n\nCreate account\n\nLog in\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPersonal tools\n\n\n\n\n\nDonate Create account Log in\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nContents\nmove to sidebar\nhide\n\n\n\n\n(Top)\n\n\n\n\n\n1\nPrinciples\n\n\n\n\nToggle Principles subsection\n\n\n\n\n\n1.1\nProcedure\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n1.2\nStages\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n2\nOptimization\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n3\nApplications\n\n\n\n\nToggle Applications subsection\n\n\n\n\n\n3.1\nSelective DNA isolation\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n3.2\nAmplification and quantification of DNA\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n3.3\nMedical and diagnostic applications\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n3.4\nInfectious disease applications\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n3.5\nForensic applications\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n3.6\nResearch applications\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n4\nAdvantages\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n5\nLimitations\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n6\nVariations\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n7\nHistory\n\n\n\n\nToggle History subsection\n\n\n\n\n\n7.1\nPatent disputes\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n8\nSee also\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n9\nReferences\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n10\nExternal links\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nToggle the table of contents\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPolymerase chain reaction\n\n\n\n71 languages\n\n\n\n\nAfrikaansالعربيةAragonésAsturianuAzərbaycancaবাংলা閩南語 / Bân-lâm-gíБеларуская (тарашкевіца)БългарскиBosanskiCatalàČeštinaDanskDeutschEestiΕλληνικάEspañolEsperantoEuskaraفارسیFrançaisGaeilgeGalego한국어Հայերենहिन्दीHrvatskiBahasa IndonesiaÍslenskaItalianoעבריתქართულიҚазақшаLatviešuLietuviųMagyarМакедонскиമലയാളംBahasa MelayuМонголNederlands日本語NordfriiskNorsk bokmålOccitanOʻzbekcha / ўзбекчаپښتوPolskiPortuguêsRomânăРусскийShqipසිංහලSimple EnglishSlovenčinaSlovenščinaСрпски / srpskiSrpskohrvatski / српскохрватскиSuomiSvenskaதமிழ்TaqbaylitతెలుగుไทยTürkçeУкраїнськаاردوTiếng Việt吴语粵語中文\n\nEdit links\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nArticleTalk\n\n\n\n\n\nEnglish\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nReadEditView history\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTools\n\n\n\n\n\nTools\nmove to sidebar\nhide\n\n\n\n\t\tActions']","The Polymerase Chain Reaction (PCR) is a laboratory method that rapidly amplifies specific DNA sequences or regions of a DNA strand.

In 2003, 454 Life Sciences launched the GS20, the first NGS DNA sequencer. This system provided reads approximately 400–500 bp long with 99% accuracy, enabling sequencing of about 25 million bases in a four-hour run at significantly lower costs compared to Sanger sequencing.[11] The sequencing machines developed by 454 represented a paradigm shift by enabling the mass parallelisation of sequencing reactions, which significantly boosted the amount of DNA sequenced per run, making 454 Life Sciences the first major success in commercial NGS technology.[12]\nAlso in 2003, Solexa began developing a competing method known as Sequencing by Synthesis (SBS). In 2004, Solexa acquired colony sequencing (bridge amplification) technology from Manteia, producing densely clustered DNA fragments (""polonies"") immobilized on flow cells. These dense clusters generated stronger fluorescent signals, improving accuracy and reducing optical costs. In 2005, Solexa integrated an engineered DNA polymerase and reversible terminator nucleotides, allowing repeated cycles of sequencing and imaging. The first commercial sequencer based on this technology, Genome Analyzer, was launched in 2006, providing shorter reads (about 35 bp) but higher throughput (up to 1 Gbp per run) and paired-end sequencing capability (i.e. both DNA strands were sequenced simultaneously).[13]\nin 2007, 454 Life Sciences was acquired by Roche[14] and Solexa by Illumina,[15] the same year Applied Biosystems introduced SOLiD, a ligation-based sequencing platform.[16] However, SOLiD encountered issues sequencing palindromic regions[17] and was eventually discontinued.[8] In 2011, Ion Torrent introduced another alternative, measuring proton (pH) changes during nucleotide incorporation using semiconductor-based sensors.[18] Ion Torrent systems rapidly produced 100 bp reads but frequently struggled with accurately sequencing homopolymers,[19] ultimately leading to their abandonment.[8]\nDue to limitations in competing methods, Illumina’s SBS technology eventually dominated the sequencing market.[8] By 2012, expectations that 454 would gain a substantial share of the sequencing market had not been realized, and Roche’s 2007 acquisition was increasingly viewed as underperforming; that same year, Roche made an unsuccessful attempt to acquire Illumina.[14] In October 2013, Roche announced that it would shut down 454, and stop supporting the platform by mid-2016.[20] By 2014, Illumina controlled approximately 70% of DNA sequencer sales and generated over 90% of sequencing data.[21][22] That year, Illumina introduced the HiSeq X Ten platform, significantly increasing throughput and claiming the long-targeted goal of sequencing human genomes at roughly $1000 each.[23] Illumina surpassed this milestone in 2017 with the release of NovaSeq, a system capable of generating over 3000 Gbp per run.[8]\n\nNGS platforms[edit]\nDNA sequencing with commercially available NGS platforms is generally conducted with the following steps. First, DNA sequencing libraries are generated by clonal amplification by PCR in vitro. Second, the DNA is sequenced by synthesis, such that the DNA sequence is determined by the addition of nucleotides to the complementary strand rather than through chain-termination chemistry. Third, the spatially segregated, amplified DNA templates are sequenced simultaneously in a massively parallel fashion without the requirement for a physical separation step. These steps are followed in most NGS platforms, but each utilizes a different strategy.[24]\nNGS parallelization of the sequencing reactions generates hundreds of megabases to gigabases of nucleotide sequence reads in a single instrument run. This has enabled a drastic increase in available sequence data and fundamentally changed genome sequencing approaches in the biomedical sciences.[25]\nNewly emerging NGS technologies and instruments have further contributed to a significant decrease in the cost of sequencing nearing the mark of $1000 per genome sequencing.[26][27]\nAs of 2014, massively parallel sequencing platforms are commercially available and their features are summarized in the  table. As the pace of NGS technologies is advancing rapidly, technical specifications and pricing are in flux.\n\n[CITATION 2]\nSOURCE: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Next-generation_sequencing              # Genomics / Methods (NGS)\nTITLE: Massively parallel sequencing - Wikipedia\nPAGE: \nCHUNK: 696\nSNIPPET: DNA colony generation (Bridge amplification)[edit] Forward and reverse primers are covalently attached at high-density to the slide in a flow cell. The ratio of the primers to the template on the support defines the surface density of the amplified clusters. The flow cell is exposed to reagents for polymerase-based extension, and priming occurs as the free/distal end of a ligated fragment ""bridges"" to a complementary oligo on the surface. Repeated denaturation and extension results in localized amplification of DNA fragments in millions of separate locations across the flow cell surface. Solid-phase amplification produces 100–200 million spatially separated template clusters, providing free ends to which a universal sequencing primer is then hybridized to initiate the sequencing reaction.[40][41] This technology was filed for a patent in 1997 from Glaxo-Welcome\'s Geneva Biomedical Research Institute (GBRI), by Pascal Mayer, Eric Kawashima, and Laurent Farinelli,[4][5] and was publicly presented for the first\nCONTENT:\nDNA colony generation (Bridge amplification)[edit]\nForward and reverse primers are covalently attached at high-density to the slide in a flow cell.

The preparation of single-molecule templates is more straightforward and does not require PCR, which can introduce errors in the amplified templates. AT-rich and GC-rich target sequences often show amplification bias, which results in their underrepresentation in genome alignments and assemblies.\nSingle molecule templates are usually immobilized on solid supports using one of at least three different approaches. In the first approach, spatially distributed individual primer molecules are covalently attached to the solid support. The template, which is prepared by randomly fragmenting the starting material into small sizes (for example,~200–250 bp) and adding common adapters to the fragment ends, is then hybridized to the immobilized primer. In the second approach, spatially distributed single-molecule templates are covalently attached to the solid support by priming and extending single-stranded, single-molecule templates from immobilized primers. A common primer is then hybridized to the template.\nIn either approach, DNA polymerase can bind to the immobilized primed template configuration to initiate the NGS reaction. Both of the above approaches are used by Helicos BioSciences. In a third approach, spatially distributed single polymerase molecules\nare attached to the solid support, to which a primed template molecule is bound. This approach is used by Pacific Biosciences. Larger DNA molecules (up to tens of thousands of base pairs) can be used with this technique and, unlike the first two approaches, the third approach can be used with real-time methods, resulting in potentially longer read lengths.\n\nSequencing approaches[edit]\nSequencing by synthesis[edit]\nThe objective for sequential sequencing by synthesis (SBS) is to determine the sequencing of a DNA sample by detecting the incorporation of a nucleotide by a DNA polymerase. An engineered polymerase is used to synthesize a copy of a single strand of DNA and the incorporation of each nucleotide is monitored. The principle of sequencing by synthesis was first described in 1993 [1] with improvements published some years later.[48] The key parts are highly similar for all embodiments of SBS and include (1) amplification of DNA to enhance the subsequent signal and to attach the DNA to be sequenced to a solid support, \xa0(2) generation of single stranded DNA on the solid support, (3) incorporation of nucleotides using an engineered polymerase and (4)  detection of the incorporation of nucleotide. Then steps 3-4 are repeated and the sequence is assembled from the signals obtained in step 4. This principle of sequencing-by-synthesis has been used for almost all massively parallel sequencing instruments, including 454, PacBio, IonTorrent, Illumina and MGI.\n\n[CITATION 3]\nSOURCE: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Next-generation_sequencing              # Genomics / Methods (NGS)\nTITLE: Massively parallel sequencing - Wikipedia\nPAGE: \nCHUNK: 700\nSNIPPET: ^ a b Bentley DR, Balasubramanian S, Swerdlow HP, Smith GP, Milton J, Brown CG, et\xa0al.

ELISA has been used as a diagnostic tool in medicine, plant pathology, and biotechnology, as well as a quality control check in various industries.\nIn the most simple form of an ELISA, antigens from the sample to be tested are attached to a surface. Then, a matching antibody is applied over the surface so it can bind the antigen. This antibody is linked to an enzyme, and then any unbound antibodies are removed. In the final step, a substance containing the enzyme\'s substrate is added. If there was binding, the subsequent reaction produces a detectable signal, most commonly a color change.\nPerforming an ELISA involves at least one antibody with specificity for a particular antigen. The sample with an unknown amount of antigen is immobilized on solid support (usually a polystyrene microtiter plate) either non-specifically (via adsorption to the surface) or specifically (via capture by another antibody specific to the same antigen, in a ""sandwich"" ELISA). After the antigen is immobilized, the detection antibody is added, forming a complex with the antigen. The detection antibody can be covalently linked to an enzyme or can itself be detected by a secondary antibody that is linked to an enzyme through bioconjugation. Between each step, the plate is typically washed with a mild detergent solution to remove any proteins or antibodies that are non-specifically bound. After the final wash step, the plate is developed by adding an enzymatic substrate to produce a visible signal, which indicates the quantity of antigen in the sample.\nOf note, ELISA can perform other forms of ligand binding assays instead of strictly ""immuno"" assays, though the name carried the original ""immuno"" because of the common use and history of the development of this method. The technique essentially requires any ligating reagent that can be immobilized on the solid phase along with a detection reagent that will bind specifically and use an enzyme to generate a signal that can be properly quantified. In between the washes, only the ligand and its specific binding counterparts remain specifically bound or ""immunosorbed"" by antigen-antibody interactions to the solid phase, while the nonspecific or unbound components are washed away. Unlike other spectrophotometric wet lab assay formats where the same reaction well (e.g., a cuvette) can be reused after washing, the ELISA plates have the reaction products immunosorbed on the solid phase, which is part of the plate and so are not easily reusable.']","ELISA, or enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay, is a commonly used analytical biochemistry assay. It is a solid-phase enzyme immunoassay designed to detect the presence of a ligand, typically a protein, in a liquid sample using specific antibodies. This method is utilized as a diagnostic tool in medicine, plant pathology, and biotechnology, notably for detecting substances like HIV.","ELISA (enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay) is an antibody-based assay that uses enzyme-conjugated detection to generate a measurable signal; it is commonly used to detect or quantify antigens (e.g., proteins) or antibodies in biological samples.",1.0,0.8192785762336571,0.9999999999,1.0
